"Last To Take Hand Off Jet, Keeps It!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3nB4PpJko,937.0,en,"- I spent two and a half million dollars on this private jet and had 11 YouTubers
put their hands on it. Whoever keeps their hand on the longest wins the private jet, but if at any point they
take their hand off, they're eliminated. The challenge has officially started. The rules are simple. You can't push someone,
and yeah, that's it. - I've got nothing on the schedule. I can stay here forever. - I am willing to do anything, including crap my own pants. - I heard there was gonna be a lot of loud and obnoxious
people on this shoot. - Get off. - No joke, the winner of this challenge
is getting a private jet. So of course the old tried
to find the best spot - I'm in the best spot, the
lowest spot on the plane. - I think I've actually got the best spot of everyone right now. - The jet is actually way
bigger than I thought. Oh. Oh. - They're making their way on
the other side of the wing- - How am I gonna do this? - Just slide your hand. - Oh. Jimmy! - So how comfortable is this position? I almost just went like, with my right hand. - Oh.
- Oh my god. - George, if you weren't
grabbing something, I think you might have let go. - No, I'm locked in. Don't worry. - Yeah. What's your strategy
for winning this thing? - I have a lot of perseverance
in my spirit, but I I gotta be honest, Speed... Speed is making it difficult. - Dude, the wheels are pretty comfortable. - I'm, yeah, you were not. We're both logical, logical people. - Exactly.
- I'm rested... Oh no. I think we might have
just got someone out. - Oh my gosh, Vik's out. - Did Vik just lose?
- Vik, are you out? - He really lifted his
hand right in front of him. - I thought this was a logical spot. - You guys tell me what you think. See Vik's hand right there? - Yeah. Yeah. - This 2.5 million jet isn't yours. - They'll pick me up when they win. - Goodbye, Vik. - Vik, you got out, but who's out next? - I think Chunkz. - Yeah, he looks like
he's petering out there. - I think Chunkz is ready to go home. - Chunkz, buddy. Word on the street is you wanna leave. - Potentially. - Would you get out if I
gave you my debit card? - What, and it works? - Yeah, of course. - No, I swear to god, now I'm tempted. - Oh, think of the video! - How much can I spend? - It'll probably stop
after ten grand, so you- After ten grand? - Yeah. Oh my God! - Here you go. I didn't! Shut up! I did not do it! - Speed's gone! Speed's gone! - I'll let you be the judge of it. I'm gonna go forward. - Where's the date? Where's the date? - Bro, that's you. Five seconds ago. So your hand comes in
the frame to high five, and he just lifts his hand- - Chunkz just made 10 grand, and made Speed leave for nothing. - I'm so disappointed. - That is crazy.
- Oh no. - Back to back out. What are you looking at? And this guy keeps following me, man. - Bye, Speed! - We're getting emoted on. - Three people have been eliminated, so I'm gonna make things harder. Conveniently, we rented
this entire airport, so we're gonna go for a walk. Karl.
- Yes. - I need you not to drive too fast. If you get them all out now, my video's two minutes long. - Hey, MrBeast Shortz. - Oh my God. Are they
about to pull the jet? - Okay, the plane is moving. We're moving. We're moving. - Get comfortable, because
got a long way to go. - No one's gonna believe
me when I told them what we're doing. - It's not like a private airport, this is a commercial. I don't
understand how he's done this. - I'm just so happy we're walking. - Is that fast enough? - It's a plane, mate. - If I lose cause I'm
challenged, fair enough. If I pull a Vik I'm fuming. - I think my hand's slowly going numb. - I can't believe we're actually competing for a private jet. - My feet are hurting. There's a big old warehouse over there. - Here's our next destination. Coming up in front. After two hours in the challenge, the boys needed a bathroom break. You wanna test our peeing method? - How are we ? - I'll be right back. Let me introduce you guys to
the good old bucket method. Hey, keep that hand on. If this hand comes off, he loses. I don't care if he's peeing. - My... is out now, by the way.
So don't come around, bro. I deserve my privacy. I missed the bucket. I'm so sorry. - We don't fake things around here. Yeah, I just need a good
clean camera shot of his hand. And throughout this entire challenge, we have an army of people
staring at their hands. We'll know if they come off the jet. - My hand's got a private
jet listening to a man pee. - Lazar. Can you come on
up to the front over here? - Ah, how? - I don't know. Figure it out. - Guys. Guys, guys. I'll give you all a ride on
my jet if you let me under. - Since you have the most subscribers, you pick the order we go in the jet. - We're going in reverse order. - No. - It's gonna be brutal. - I'm on the carpet.
Is it that funny, Terry? - It's hilarious. He's
literally crawling up here. - Please let me under. Let me under. - I'm sorry. We're getting serious now. - Wow. - Might be a bit sticky though. - Oh.
- Ooh! - Why's your hand like that?
- What are you doing? - It's working. Guys, please, please. - Sorry man. - How can I get through? - Sorry man. You guys, don't push him off. It's literally down to fingertips there. - No, shut up. - Oh, this is awful. This is awful. - This is nice.
- Yeah. - I could see my... I mean, my friend flying
up in the sky in this. - Whoever wins this jet has
to give it to someone else. 'Cause obviously these guys are YouTubers. They don't need a private jet. - It could be you if you
subscribe to my channel. - If he wins. - I'm on.
- Yeah. - So what do you think of the jet, boys? Solid. - There's eight seats and eight
of you, but for us to fly, I need to sit here, so I kind
of need someone to get out. - Oh.
- Oh! - Just let me know whatever
one of you wants to get out. - All right, Jimmy! - I left them alone in the jet for hours, and no one got out, so I made
them do laps around the plane. - You start going... - Oh, what? I'm gonna
go like under the plane. - I'm coming over here. - Someone has to get
out. In case you forgot, this jet is literally two
and a half million dollars. These boys got a lot on the line. - My hand goes off this, I'm done. - Don't worry, man.
You're just winging it. - Never speak to me again, please. - I'm not getting back on that
plane until someone's lost. - You need to entice
these guys to leave, man. - Why? I don't need to. When you're sleepy, it's game over. - It's Will. I'm telling you. Will is the one to go for. He's cracking. - 20K. I'll go. - I heard some deals are happening. What's going on? They've offered me 20 K from the winner, if I take my hand off now. - The winner wins a jet. Not money. - Are you fine with us making that deal? - Yeah, if you guys pay him 20 grand. - Yeah.
- Oh! - All right, thank you for... Oh my god. That hand's sweaty. Now that Will is out, that means we can fly the jet around. Everyone, get in the jet. This is nice. - The inside, the only thing in play is the exterior. The chairs and stuff
like that do not count. - I'm gonna be honest. I think I'm out. - What'd you do? - The chair. - Oh, that's honest of you though. - Ready?
No, it's got a good angle. - Definitely not on the wood. - At least he was honest,
he ratted on himself. - Thank you, Jimmy. - No problem. A bit sweaty. - I know, it hasn't come off the jet. - Let's see this bad boy in the air. Good evening, gentlemen. Be on our way fairly shortly. - On our way where, can I ask? - Yeah, just, just lay back. - I'll chill out. I'll chill. - I really hope you guys didn't, you know, when you had your hands
on the outside the plane, mess anything up. - What you mean?
- Oh, come on. - I don't know. I'm just saying. - If this plane crashes, do I get to keep all of their channels? - Always says the wildest stuff before we- - That did not sound good. - This is it. - There she goes. - In case you're
wondering, this jet works. - Harry's face kills me.
- It feels wrong. It feels like a tin can. Anything could hit us out the sky. - Boys. What way are we going? - There's a lot of lights that way. So that could be London. So we could be going... I've got nothing. - It's just so funny seeing the wing you guys were just slapping... - Speed was-
- Oh! Oh! - We've just got on the flight
and his hand's come off. And the best part is, he has to fly to the next destination and back with us out after he's out. After over an hour in the air, I still didn't tell them
where we were going. We may or may not be landing soon. Where do you think we are? - I have no idea.
- Dublin. - Liverpool.
- Milan. - Look for the Eiffel Tower.
- Ireland. - Scotland.
- I reckon it's Southend Airport. I
reckon we just did a lap. - Where are we?
- Where you think about Beast? - Oh, whoa.
- Whoa. - That's the hangar. We just did a lap. - That's right. I just told the pilot
to fly around in circles for a couple hours. Oh, thank god. - Congratulations, you got pranked. We went in a circle. Boys, come on out. This is
where the real fun begins. Everyone's tired. They're freezing. The challenge is gonna get interesting. - In the hangar we go. Again. - It's time to feed the contestants. I bought things like steak and spaghetti that are really hard to eat with one hand. - Oh, is that spaghetti? - A wooden fork? For a steak. - After dinner, I have a special surprise for all of you. See you in a bit.
- Special surprise? Imagine he says someone's out. ""I hope you enjoyed that meal."" We're down to the final five.
It's time we get serious. I need you guys to pair
up into groups of two. I'm saying no more. - Oh, there's only five of us. - Brother. Yes?
- Me and you both. Me and you. Come on, we've got this. - I'm alone. I've been ditched. - Karl, you know what to do. - Left hands Put 'em together. - Oh, what is this? - I feel like I might have
gotten away with something, but I don't know what's coming. Is something happening bad to me? - Come here, George. - I don't know if this is even fair. They can move their arm.
I can't move my arm. Oh George. No George. - I'll just sit here. - If Lazar wins, a nine
year old kid gets the jet. If Niko wins, his editor gets the jet. - When I was five, I was really ill. I had leukemia, so I'm gonna find someone, and try and give them the
start that I didn't have after that.
- Wow. - Yeah, I was trying to change- - So you'll find someone
who recovers from leukemia, give them a jet?
- Yeah. I'm gonna try my best. - I would find someone who's
willing to sell the jet, and then donate all that
money to a children's charity. - Really?
- No. - We are bonded forever after this. Is this all right? - Me and Mr. Lazar have
found the best position. - I met you 24 hours ago. Now look at us. - Lean your head on my
chest, turn to the side, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Aw, man.
- There you go. - How's it going on down there? - Our little . - This is literally the biggest
prize I've ever given away, and they're starting to get
a little too comfortable. I banned the wings to make it harder, but it doesn't seem like that's working. They have 60 seconds to stand up. - I think I know what's
coming and it's not good. - Okay, everyone is standing again. - Yes. Let's go with the routine. - Since nobody was getting out, I'm gonna bring out the red tape. I decided to give them
even less room on the jet. If you touch the red line, or go below it, you are out, starting now. We're in this together. Let's see how badly they want this jet. - You allowed to do that? - What?
- Hold your hand. - Why not? - No wonder you haven't moved. You've been holding it in place. - We've been doing this
for like an hour now, and everyone is still
kind of going strong. I guess Harry's looking a bit wobbly. - It's 5:00 AM I think I'm
more tired than they are. - We have a proposition. I'm gonna coin flip this
young gentleman over here. Whoever loses takes
their hand off the jet. - Heads, you stay on, tails you stay on, a $2.5 million jet on the line. - Oh my God.
- Oh hell, watch out. Oh! - Get off the jet.
- It's on heads. - Get off the jet! - Is he a man of his word? - Oh! - How does it feel to be free? - It's very not... But I miss him, man. I miss my boy. - I believe in you.
Harry. Hold that hand up. See you later.
- Little bit. - See ya, boys. I'm going to bed. - I wish I could. To celebrate Callux getting out, I say we make it harder. Everyone pick a finger. - This beauty here. - As of now, that is, is all that matters. - I'm gonna go with the pointer. - Okay. Pointer as well. Everyone's pointer finger. From now on, that is the
only finger that matters, till you guys start dropping. - I'm not good. - It's so difficult now. - This is painful. I'm only 10 seconds in. - I have the benefit of
this other hand there. - We need to get our tape
off to be fair with Harry. - Give it like 30 minutes and
I'll cut all the tape off. - Can I coin flip it? Take my tape off if I get heads? - If you'll leave. Sure. - Let's flip the coin. Heads, take it off. I'm doing this for you, Niko. - Tails. That means he's out. - I didn't have a chance
unless we took this tape off. Oh, I'm sorry Niko. You've
gotta take it home, buddy. It's for Niko. - It's for Niko.
- Oh my God. - Take it home, buddy. - I'll let you pick. Do we make George wait the 30 minutes, or do I cut him out now? - I wanna see a fair ending. Take it off. Take it off. - Okay, I appreciate that. - I wanna see a of willpower. - Good luck. Keep your finger on the jet. - This is what I needed for me to win. - It's gonna be so
disrespectful when you lose. - If you win. Who is getting this jet? - I think it's just
gonna have to be my mom. I've got no one else. - I really want to give
it to my editor, George. - We should call your editor. George. What's up man? - Oh my gosh. - Now, Niko is saying that if he wins, he's giving this jet to you. Do you have any words of
encouragement for Niko? - Encouragement is you've gone this far. You can go the extra mile. - Thank you, George. Thank you. - I'm gonna split it between
my brother and my sister. - Oh really? - I grew up with them, man, so I wanna try and give
them something special. The sun's coming through out there. I'm seeing daylight. That's the only way we can
actually tell the time. This is very tough. - My arm is dying. - You ready to make this a little harder? I need you to face that direction. Oh look, I've done it. - Yeah yeah. There you go. - I'm like losing... - Oh, I should just gone like that. - Yeah. There we go. Niko is struggling here. - Just get out already.
- I can't. - Come on. - Now's not the time, Nolan. - I left them alone for a while and then we caught something
on one of our cameras. - One of you-
- Oh no, oh no... - has gotten out. Who do you think it is? - It's me! - Someone go review his footage. It was not, I got something
I need to show you. Is that your hand? - Maybe? - Is that your hand?
- That is my hand. - It was literally off, for
no joke, one singular frame. - I gotta take my hand off? - Well, I mean you can leave it on, but you're not winning the jet, man. Aw, guys. - There was clear airspace. Wow. Well played, guys. - It is now down to George and Harry. - I want you to check though. - I'm going to check Harry. - Can't believe I was
this close to win it. Who do I think's gonna win? I feel like- - Who do you think's gonna win? What do you mean? How about here's who did win. Don't tell 'em who it is. Gentlemen. The challenge
is officially over. - No, I know when it happened, a minute before you came
out, it skipped over, no! - Harry.
- No! - I'm sorry man. But you can go ahead and
take your finger off. If you look right here. See that finger?
- Mhm. - It's not Harry's. It's actually George's. - No.
- Wait. You're trolling. You actually trolled me. - Yeah. Harry? You just won! - Yes! Come on! Oh yeah! - George, you were this close. - What? - But close doesn't matter. Harry just won this jet! - Yes!
- Oh, you're all so sweaty. Congratulations. Who are
you giving the jet to? My brother and my sister. Let's go to them right now. - Three, two, one. - No no no no...
- I swear to God. Subscribe to MrBeast. He's a legend. Buy all his chocolate and stuff. - Everything.
- And in case you're wondering we're gonna offset all the carbon emitted during the filming of
this video by tenfold. And we're also gonna offset
any future carbon emitted by the winner of this jet."
"Would You Rather Have $100,000 OR This Mystery Key?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qAJMXfL6o0,1101.0,en,"- [Jimmy] As you guys know,
I like to give away money, but in this video, we're gonna
do it a little different. I'm gonna give people a choice. Would you rather have
this $10,000 in cash, or this key that goes
to something expensive? (key slamming)
You have 10 seconds to decide. - 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five- (Javier groaning) - Which is it?
(timer ticking) Ten grand, or-
- Four, three, two- - The key, the key, the key,
the key, the key, the key. - Okay. (team clapping)
- Yeah. We hate money! Woo! - You just turned down $10,000. You don't know what this
key goes to. (laughing) - Okay. I'm not really sure
if I should have took the key, but my gut feeling says
like, you gotta take the key. So I gotta go with my
gut. Gotta go with my gut. (team chanting)
- Guts. Guts. Guts. Guts! (Javier laughing) (team chanting)
- Key. Key. Key. Key. - All right. So.
(upbeat music playing) Right around this corner over here, you'll see what this key goes to. - Okay. - Cover his eyes.
- Hold on, hold on. - All right. Face that way. - Javier. Take your hat off. (team clapping)
- No way! - You just-
- No way! - A brand new car! Guess how much it's worth. - More than 10 grand? - It's worth $26,000.
(cash register dinging) - Woo!
(team cheering) - Let's go.
- You wanna get a shot? - Yeah. (team chanting)
- Javier. Javier. - Where you wanna go, boys? - Hey, guess what? You win something else.
- What is it? - I'll give you your wallet back. - My wallet? - Javier, you took the risk. You got the W, what do you wanna say? - Listen to your gut.
I had a good feeling. - Gut gang. - Congratulations on your $26,000 car. Throughout this video, we're
giving away many more cars and hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is just the beginning. Next scene. This next giveaway is two diamonds. One of these diamonds is worth $25. And one of these diamonds is worth 6,000. Go ahead. You can touch
'em, do whatever you want. One is worth $6,000, and
one is worth only 25. - Okay. I have no clue, but
because I'm standing right here, I'm gonna pick this one. - I'm stressed. So can you tell any difference
between the two diamonds? - This one looks faker.
- What does that mean? - It looks plastic. My
hands are like this. - Why is this hand twitching
so much more than that? - Because I feel like-
- That one's heavier. That means that's the diamond. - It's this one. - So your choice is this diamond. - It's my diamond.
- Yes. - Oh gosh. It's the fake one.
(box clicking) - No way.
(buzzer sounding) - The most important thing you
got out of this, friendship. - Until you leave, then it's over. (contestant laughing) - For our next giveaway,
I want you to flip this. This side says $0 and this
side says a thousand dollars. Give it a flip.
- Woo! - We want-
- Yeah, big money! (team cheering)
(cash register dinging) - Okay, hold up. Now you can keep that thousand dollars, or you can risk it to flip this. This side is $0, and this side is $10,000. (participant clapping) - For sure. - I want it at least above your head. - All right. - All right. And...
(cardboard clattering) (team cheering)
(cash register dinging) - Wait. What?
- Stay right here. Do not move. Taylor, don't let him move. - Dude. What was going
through your mind? $10,000. - I didn't wait this whole time for a thousand dollars.
(Taylor clapping) - That's what I'm talking bout! - I'm going big, or I'm going home! - Once in a life time opportunity here! - All right!
- Oh. - You can risk your $10,000
for a chance at $20,000. But this side still says zero. (team chanting)
- Do it, do it, do it. (Jimmy clapping)
- I am. (cardboard clattering)
(team cheering) - He did it!
- $20,000. I'll be right back.
(team laughing) - I don't know, man. I don't know if I wanna keep going. - There's no way he goes for this. - [Person Offscreen] No way. - [Jimmy] I think you're
crazy if you do this, but $40,000 or zero. - I'm gonna call my girlfriend
and I'm gonna FaceTime her. - Babe.
- Hey babe. - Your man just won $20,000. No joke. - No! - If it lands on this side, it's $0, it lands on this side, it's 40,000, or he could just walk away with 20 grand. - Babe, 20 grand's a lot...
- I don't know, man. I'm gonna be honest. I came here to win.
- Ooh. - And I felt I've done that.
(disappointed audience track) - Oh yeah. I thought he was gonna say, ""I came here to win, so let's do it."" - I'm gonna settle for the 20.
(cash register dinging) - I am curious if you would have won. - Man, don't do that to me.
(upbeat music playing) - Come on.
- You gotta see. (Jimmy clapping)
- Come on. - Are we listening to Taylor?
(cardboard clattering) (team cheering)
(buzzer sounding) - Listen to me. - Our next bit is gonna
be an interesting one. So this is Anna and as high as she counts, I'll give her money. So just count to ten. - One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - So no joke. You can
count as high as you want. And every single number you count, I will give you a dollar at the end of it. - Okay. - The only stipulation
is, if you skip a number, you go back to zero. - Okay.
- Go ahead and start. - One, two, three, four, five- - Have fun counting.
- 87, 88. - Steele, do not let her skip a number. - 91 92 93- 104, 105,
113, 114, 128, 129, 130- - [Jimmy] 140, 143, 144, 145, - 131
- Works every time. - Start over.
(Anna screaming) - Next up is Juliana. You can take $2,000 in cash, or shoot a free throw for $10,000. - Make. - Make a free throw for $10,000.
It should go in the hoop. - I'm gonna shoot a basketball. - Wait really?
- She's puttin' her hair up! (Taylor clapping)
- Okay. - Okay.
- Okay. I'm a little nervous. This is $10,000. - Shh. I'm thinking. - Okay.
(team conversing) Chandler, stop talking.
(ball bouncing) - Come on. Here we go. First time- (electronic chord playing)
- Woo! (team cheering)
(Juliana screaming) - Yay! Yeah!
(team cheering) (palms slapping) - She stepped it up. She
knew what she had to do. - I told you, I played before. - Here you go. Plop that cash in here. This is now your briefcase full of money. Guys, is this for real? - Congratulations on your money. Chandler, let's do something fun. Do you wanna bet $10,000 that you make it? If you make this free throw,
I'll give you 10 grand. But if you miss, you give me 10 grand, which I'll donate to charity.
You don't have to do it. - I want to, but I'm very
nervous that I'm gonna miss. (Juliana laughing) (ball bouncing) - It's just a car. Rent for a year. (Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling) (buzzer sounding)
(team exclaiming) Wow, I love how he almost
threw the ball at Chris, like Chris did something. (team exclaiming in slow motion) (ball bouncing)
(Jimmy laughing) - This ain't fair. I got this new ring on
and it messed me up. - Why don't you go hug him. - Ryan, we need huggies. - None of y'all are my friends. None of y'all talked me out of it. - I wanted to, but I'm so
confident in your skills. - It's gonna be okay.
- Just think about charity. I've always wondered if
I dropped tons of money, how much could you catch? Let's find out. And...
(crane whining) Right here. Okay. We have Tim down there in the circle, and we have tons of money. Let's do a little sprinkle. Sprinkage. All right, Chandler, join us. Whatever you catch, you
can keep, by the way. (Tim grunting) Oh, does this feel
condescending to anyone else? (Chandler cheering)
What if we throw it at him? - Hey!
- Hey, I'm ready. - Let's go, boys.
(cash fluttering) (team laughing) Chandler, hit it off the ceiling. (team laughing) - No! - The money is literally
stuck in the ceiling. - Yo, we gotta get it down. - Are you guys curious? What
the girls counting are up to? - Yeah, actually. - 6784, 6785, 6786. - Wow. I can't believe they're that high. We're high as well.
- We should go down. - Just get us to a point where
if we fell, we wouldn't die. How much money did you catch? - $1,929. (cash register dinging)
- And according to Google, that's when the Great
Depression hit. Yeah! - Woo!
(palms slapping) - Up next is Noah. Now I want you to pick,
hat, shirt, or umbrella. - Hat. - He was very confident in that. (team cheering)
(Chandler clapping) - Let's go! - Okay. And now we go up again. Are you ready? We ready for what? - There's $8,071 in this box. Whatever you catch, you can keep. I'm literally about to
dump a ton of money. It would've been 10 grand,
but the other guy took, it was like-
- 1929. - Oh yeah. The Great Depression. Here we go.
- Ready... (cash thudding) - Oh!
- Oh, oh no. - Oh, you're dropping it. - I'm holding too hard. - Okay. We're dropping more. - What?
- Just scurry away. - Oh, god...
- Scurry. - [Person Offscreen] What are you gonna do with this money, man? - I'm gonna see if he'll let
me buy his Tesla with it. - Ain't no rainy days here. - You really couldn't have told me I was not making a good
choice when I chose the hat? - You chose the hat so
quickly. I didn't even- - Oh my God. - Are you counting? - Somehow Noah caught $1,920,
(cash register dinging) exactly $9 less than the other guy. - Now I do need to ask you though, would you be willing to
take $1,900 for your Tesla? - How about if you beat
a different challenge? I might consider it.
- Okay. - So gimme a second. - I don't, I didn't know that
I could just challenge Jimmy for his Tesla.
(palms clapping) (both laughing) There's no way I'll win
to Tesla here. Right? - I have 10 cups and I'm
gonna grab a cheese ball. If he guesses the cup with a cheese ball, he can have a Tesla. In this ZHC video, ZHC gave
me a customized MrBeast Tesla. But at the end of the video, I had Chris and Chandler play
rock paper scissors for it. - I won.
- And Chris won. Chandler. You sad about that? If he wins, can I just
buy you a new Tesla? - Yeah, I guess so. - Perfect.
(Jimmy clapping) Noah, come on over. There's 10 cups here. One has a cheese ball
under it. If you pick it, I will give you Chris's Tesla. (Noah sighing) All right, fine. It's not this one. There.
- Okay. (Jimmy thumping table)
- Now you have a one in nine chance. I'm not doing that again.
I'm gonna go over here. - By the way. If you win it,
you have to clean it out. There's a lot of trash in the back. - You gonna pick?
- Oh. (electronic chord playing)
- Oh! - (laughing) Wait!
- No way! (Noah cheering)
- Did he actually get it? - I've given away my car, I guess! - So I really randomly won? - There is only one.
(cups clattering) - Oh my God.
- How did you do that? - That's crazy!
(Chris laughing) - On the bright side, you get $1,900. - Oh no. You get to keep your $1,900. - I get to keep the money too? - Yeah, you can keep it. (Noah and Jimmy laughing)
(Noah clapping) - One in nine?
- Got the Tesla for you. - And it comes with all his clothes. I cannot believe I just won a Tesla. - You wanna get in your new car? - Oh, absolutely. - Hey Chris, do you mind
unlocking it for him? - Oh, it's unlocked already. - Oh my God. Let's go! A Tesla's my dream car, too. - Same. - Now, your friend
literally only got $1,900, and you walked away with a $50,000 car. - He's the reason I was
invited here today, too. So thank you, Tim. - I'm sorry. - I kind of want my new Tesla to be black. - Huddle up. Huddle up. Huddle up. Okay. Now that Chris
no longer owns a Tesla, Let's go back to filming. - Yeah. Yeah.
- All right. - For this next bit, we're
giving away another car. This is Cameron. He was in this video.
(video popping) But you're back,
(Jimmy clapping) and you can win money this time. - Woo. - Listen to this sound.
(engine revving) Sounds like a car. And
listen to sound number two. (engine revving) Also sounds like a car,
but here's the thing. Only one of those sounds is an actual car, and the other is fake. If you guess which one's
real, you get a car. - One more time. (engine revving) - Ooh. You can hear that shifting in that. Sounds like a fart first.
(all laughing) I don't know, I really like the shifting
that I can hear from this one. So I'm gonna go with number one for sure. - I'm going to show you where
we got audio clip number one. - Okay.
- Karl, come here. - Okay.
- All right. So I want you to show them. I hate stuff like this. - That was, oh my gosh. No way. - This is what you picked. This right here.
(Cameron laughing) I'm gonna show you what
you could have got. - Oh no. - This is what you could have had. - Wow.
- Oh come on, jump up in that. (all laughing) - Karl! You guys might be able to tell by now, I don't handle people losing well. Take over Karl.
(Karl laughing) - Oh no. Look your car's coming. - No!
- Drive by! - [Cameron] No, I don't like that car. (trombone buzzing) - Bye Cameron. Good luck.
- No. - Good luck with your trumpet.
- We got more to film. - You know what they say?
Third times the charm. I'm giving you a chance to
remake the $10,000 you lost, again again, and before he shoots this
free throw for $5,000, let's go check on the girls counting. They're probably close to $10,000. - 9177.
- Wow. - 9178. - All right. So you're
getting close to 10,000. (Anna cheering)
- Wow. - Sheets of- - I know, it looks like
someone's having a manic episode. - Wait. What was I? 91- - 43, 82, 71-
- 94- - Six, three, eight, 99,504.
(girls chanting numbers) - Hey Chandler. So they're at
a really, really high number. Honestly. I'm kind of
surprised, but anyways, you wanna shoot this free throw? - Yeah. (upbeat music playing) (bell dinging)
Yes! (cash register dinging)
Yes! - Okay.
- Yes! - If you make this three
pointer, you get $10,000. (ball bouncing) (bell dinging) (all cheering)
- Yes, yes! Yes, yes. - You have now won 10 grand, which makes up for the
10 grand you lost here. Play the clip. - Oh.
- Yes, yes. - No, the clip of him losing 10 grand. (Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling) - Oh!
(all exclaiming) Do you wanna risk your $10,000 for 20,000? I know you do. Come on. - [Chris] Yeah. Hoo! Hoo! Hold up. We're grabbing a car. (trombone buzzing) Thank you. (basket rattling)
(bell dinging) (all cheering)
- Let's go! (Chandler clapping) - He made it. - Gimme this thing. - (Jimmy) Let me take this. You just won $20,000,
(Chandler clapping) which technically is 10,000, 'cause you owe me 10,000. Ball me. That's a trombone.
(trombone clattering) If you stand behind this line,
which is really far away, show the viewers. - It's almost-
- 50 grand. (ball bouncing) - You think I can make this? - No. (claps)
- Honestly. Everyone's really quiet. - Go broke or go home. - It's more than broke. If he misses this, he
still owes me 10 grand. Play the clip. (Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling) - Oh!
(all exclaiming) - It is a good clip. Let's watch it one more time. (Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling) - Oh!
(all exclaiming) Play it a hundred times on
the screen at the same time. (Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling) - Oh!
(all exclaiming) - Tyler?
- Yes. - Do you think it's dumb
for him to risk $20,000 for this shot? - Absolutely not, because
it's not my money. (Chandler slapping ball)
So let's do it. (ball bouncing)
- Chandler! Chandler! - Yeah! (team chanting)
- Chandler! Chandler! - Oh, that's off.
(buzzer sounding) (Chandler groaning)
- I want to die. - Buddy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I need to just stop putting
you in these predicaments. - Yeah.
(playful music playing) - I'm just gonna start
just giving you money, so you can't lose it. - That would be great. - (laughing) Okay. - 11,150, 11,151, 11,152, 11- - We can't just let 'em count forever. Let's give 'em a time limit. - Jimmy. If you keep letting
them count too much longer, it's gonna cost you an arm and a leg. (trombone buzzing sadly) - We have some news we have to break. You have one hour starting now. Okay. And then we're gonna come back up, and give you whatever you're at. - Okay.
- All right. - And you also have to restart? - No.
(all laughing) - Oh my God. - From 11,248, 11,249. - Good luck.
- Have fun. - 11,251, 11,252- - I hope you make a lot of money. - Thank you. 11- - Three six five eight nine 10. (Anna screaming) So here's how it works, Troy. If you guess the cup with
the car key, you win the car. - Oh. - You got this.
- Yes. - Let's go. - Karl, I'd like you to escort Troy where he can't see the cups, and use this if he gets
a little aggressive. - Right this way.
(upbeat music playing) We're gonna teach your swing. Okay? - Okay.
- Perfect. Just like that. All right. - All right. So we're gonna take this. (key clattering) Okay. We're gonna take this.
(cups clattering) - Looks a little wobbly. - Keep looking in that direction
and not that direction. - Troy. Come see if you win a car. - Okay.
- There's eight cups here. Two have car keys. I'm gonna go under here. - Gosh. You're smart, Jimmy. - Hover over the cup you
think has a car key in it. - Don't touch it. 25% chance.
- This one. - That?
- Yes. - All right. You wanna lift it up? - Yes. - Oh, oh-
(all cheering) - Let's go. Let's go!
(Troy screaming) - Let's take him out outside
and show him his brand new car. Tada! - Woo!
(all cheering) Come on!
- Look at that, man! - [Karl] Watch out. - Karl, no.
- Oh. (laughing) - All right. Hop on in. - I'm feeling really
good. I won a car, dude. We good. - Watching Troy win a car kind of made me feel bad
for you losing 10 grand. (Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling) - Oh!
(all exclaiming) - But you did have this
chance here to win it back. - Oh, that's off.
(ball bouncing) - Yeah. I didn't. - Zach, come here. We're going to let your
brother try to redeem you and win your 10 grand back.
- Oh my gosh. - You pick, red balloon or white balloon? - White.
- Pop a white. - Go for like the four right
there. You see the four? - Oh, that's a good idea. (balloon popping)
- Yes! (cash register dinging)
- Okay. Step back. This is for five grand. Pop a red. - Oh, red? - Karl, you can just stand over there. (Karl laughing) - Go for the four right there. - That one, or that one? - That one. - Oh. Okay. Wait. (balloon popping)
(cash register dinging) - Yeah. Let's go! - Okay.
- I'm halfway out of the hole. - Take a step back. This one is for $10,000. Chandley you might wanna hype him up. - Come on, Zach. You got this. There's four right here.
Just like we've been doing. - And don't forget. None of
this money's going to you. It's for him. - Yeah. You got this. - That's awesome. - All right. Pop a red balloon. I'm nervous. - I am too. (balloon popping) (cash register dinging)
- Yes, yes. - Let's go.
(palm slapping) - Okay. Now Chandler,
you are now outta debt. You lost 10 grand here, (Jimmy gasping)
(basket rattling) - Oh!
(all exclaiming) and he just won 10 grand back. But!
(balloon popping) He can risk it for 20 grand. - No. - Jimmy, I'm going for it. Come on. - Really? This is for up 10 grand.
We're good right now. - We're going for it. - All right. (laughing) Chandler, you might be at 10. - Okay.
(balloon popping) (Zach cheering)
(cash register dinging) - We're rich! - Well, Chandler got money. - Wait. - You were playing for Chandler. - You got money.
- Chandler got money. - Yeah. - Let's do 30,000. - Oh my gosh.
- We're not doing it anymore. I'm good. (claps)
- I'm going. - He's going for it. If you
hit this, you boys get $30,000. But if you miss- (dart thudding) - Freak!
(buzzer sounding) - You're an idiot.
- Oh shit. (maudlin piano music playing)
- You're an idiot, Zach. (hat thudding) - We've got cheese balls, though. Oh wait-
(balloon bouncing) we-
- Bro, it's not that hard. (balloon popping)
It's not that hard, man. - At least you two are still
brothers hug it up, hug it up. We have each other.
- But not 10 grand. - I'm handsome.
(buzzer sounding) - The girls' timer just
hit zero formation, boys. (chanting grunts) - [Karl] Could you imagine
hearing this coming towards you? - We should probably stop it.
They might be weirded out. - 14,439. - Stop your counting.
What is your final number? - 14,439. - You just made $14,439.
(cash register dinging) - Yay.
(all cheering) - What are you gonna buy with it? - I'm gonna pay my student loans off. - Yes. Student loans!
(all cheering) - Come on over here. This is $14,000. (cash register dinging)
(girls screaming) 339 bucks. (girls screaming) That's loud. They're screaming very loud. (girls screaming) I've seen people less excited-
- Oh my god! - to win a hundred grand on the show. All right, there you go.
- Oh my God. - Yeah. They're kind of heavy. And you got this briefcase. Here, you forgot a little bit of money. (girls screaming) I'm doing another one

7 Days Stranded In A Cave,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndAQfTzlVjc,1079.0,en,"I don't
normally do intros like this, but I'm currently descending
hundreds of feet into a cave that runs over
five kilometers deep into the Earth, and whether we like it or not. As soon as my friends
and I touch the ground, we are officially stranded here
for the next seven days. That might have been the scariest
thing I've ever done. First things first, we got to
get really far away - from where we rappelled down. 
- Why? If it storms, this entire area
could flash flood, fill up like an ocean,
and potentially drown us all. Which is why we're going deep
into the cave to set up base camp. Oh, this is just wicked. Dude, this is like a different world. This cave entrance may be beautiful,
but looks can be deceiving. We didn't know it yet, but the next seven days will by far
be the hardest of our entire lives. Worst idea ever. All right. It's going to get
dark in a couple hours. If we don't have a camp,
we're screwed. Okay? You don't have any idea 
where you're going. We're just looking for flat ground
to set up camp. Upon entering the mouth of the cave. We stumbled upon an area with high
enough elevation to protect us from any flash flooding, meaning
that it was perfect for camp. - Perfect is a crazy word.
- Good enough, is what I would use. Good enough for camp. We spent the rest of day one grabbing our supplies
that we were dropped with. Each one of these bags
weighs like 80 pounds. And as you can see by the footage,
we spent around four hours. This is very hard to traverse. Getting all of it
back up to our base camp. All right,
we've got some lights on in here. Our supplies are finally
at our home base. And if you point the camera over
there, you'll see it's pitch black. It took all day. And so we set up the bare minimum
for camping grounds. We drilled holes
to hang up some ropes. Grab this. 
Pull yourself up. It looks like the ropes will be able
to support hammocks. And with the help of our survival
guide, Joel, we hung our hammocks. This thin rope is what 
holds up my hammock? Yeah. Ate some dinner and prepared
for a very cold night one. Not gonna lie, this hammock is way more comfortable
than I thought it would be. Hey! Oh, God. Why is my head so big, bro? This cave is 2.5
kilometers deep, and we're basically camping
at the entrance. Tomorrow, we have a lot of exploring. How'd you guys sleep? - Horribly 
- I didn't. It's a very perplexing environment. The caves constantly
dripping water on us from above. So we put a tarp over us. But even still, the water's
dripping into our hammocks. I have an idea. Let's make our shelter
actually good. I say we connect these tarps
so we stay dry while we're sleeping here. That's literally genius. I'm not just a YouTuber, okay? My hammock gets out right here. Are we serious right now? This is where I just got out of bed. And we didn't realize it at the time,
but this hole is almost 40ft deep. So while Shawn and I got started
on the super tarp, Mack and Karl went to see how dangerous
this hole was for themselves. You see my hammock up there?
That is where I slept. Now look at this. And because everything
looks the same, and it's probably pretty hard
to follow us in this cave. On this map,
you could see our home base and how far they're moving
away from it. - All right, Mack. It's been real, bro.
- Bro, this is crazy. Well,
the boys are randomly exploring. Me and Shawn actually
have to work on the camp. Why is there a sleeping bag over here? Because it smelled like pee. Lesson number one,
don't rent your sleeping bags. Why did we rent sleeping bags? Why did we not just buy sleeping bags? We're zip tying the tarps together
to create one mega tarp. Don't mind me just trusting
this rope with my life. And meanwhile,
Mack and Karl were still in a hole. Oh my God, Mack. And eventually
they finally made it to the bottom. We're supposed to be working on camp. We just want to show how dangerous
camp was. Just don't fall. 
It's a skill issue. Oh, okay. And even though they should
have been on their way back, Karl and Mack insisted on seeing 
how deep they could go. Bro, this just looks so crazy. You think you can
make it through the river? But little do these two know, this river actually runs
throughout the entire cave. Which means we'll be spending
some time in it. Oh, there they are. - Tell me you guys cooked.
- We cooked. That's right. - A new home, am I right?
- Let's go. - We now have a roof. 
- Look at this. I'm not going to lie, 
you actually kind of cooked. And we moved the fire pit 
to this little cove we found. What do you think? - It's warmer. 
- It's cozy. These rocks trap the heat here and
block the pee from the rocks above. It's not pee. - What do I call it?
- I don't know, maybe rain or something. But it's not rain. It's rock. Hey, point it up, do you see clouds? No. You see rocks. 
It's not rain. - Rock pee.
- Rock pee. Rock pee, fine. All right, it's rock pee. And after a much drier
night of sleep, we decided to have Joel,
our survival expert, help us get all the way
to the end of the cave. - Cave!
- Cave! - Cave!
- Cave! - Cave!
- Cave! Cave! Let's see how deep in the cave
we can make it. Now, keep in mind, we are still just at the beginning
of this massive cave. And our goal is to make it all
the way through it, without dying, of course. Oh, my gosh,
this is kind of steep. You ain't seen nothing yet. We're going deep in the cave. - All right boys, suck in your guts.
- This is where things get tight. I don't actually think I'm going to fit. The interesting part about cave
exploration is one second you're barely fitting through cracks
in the rock. Oh, my God, this is so tight. And then the next, you're
in a massive chamber so big that in order to see it all,
we had to do this. Oh my God. I can actually see now. This is awesome. This thing is bright. Well, look at how cool this is. Yeah! - So bright I can't even look at it.
- I'm getting blinded. Oh, no. Oh, no. In hindsight, we probably didn't use
that the most effectively. Lead the way. And so we continued on. Feel free, there's a really 
good handle up the top there. And then you can sort of swing
a foot around onto this one. Yeah, yeah, 
perfect. Joel, the best caving guide ever. No one's died yet. All right, guys, this
is where things get interesting. What? What is this? So from this point on, wetsuits. We're going for a swim. Yesterday, Mack and Karl
were joking about doing this, but the rest of this cave adventure takes place in a freezing river. Oh my gosh, this is insane. Meaning wetsuits are the only way 
to not get hypothermia. Why are we doing this? This is a once
in a lifetime experience. Because you die after you do it. So in order
to get to the end of the cave, we have to hop in this river
and fight the rapids through this tiny hole in the rocks and carefully squeeze
our way through. Take your time. It will take your feet 
behind you a little bit. All right. I'm getting in the river. You wanna follow the wall 
around to the left. It’s so cold! You got it, Jimmy. I don't know if I fit. Jimmy, I need you to pull yourself
up out of the water. Oh my God.
What's crazy about doing this, Oh, it's so cold. Is when you're completely submerged
in freezing cold water. Gripping onto the rocks
becomes incredibly hard. Oh, my gosh, that was crazy. Mack, Karl, let's go. I'm scared, bro. You got this. - Bro.
- Keep going. Look how crazy this is, dude. And even though this obstacle was
difficult, it's nothing compared to what's up ahead. We did it! - Cave, cave, cave.
- Cave, cave. Hey, boys,
we're now 10% done. Which means we've only scratched
the surface of this expedition. And we still have over two kilometers
remaining to reach the end. As you can see, it
rains in this cave 24/7. So I'm making a chill spot
for us to hang out and not get wet. I wonder what I would look like
if I wasn't here to build all this. Pretty sure they'd just be sleeping
in a pile on a wet rock. It's important that we keep moving now that the bodies are wet. Temperatures are going to drop quickly. Why is this so difficult? The worst part is, every inch
we go this way is an inch. we got to go
that way to get back to camp. Our next obstacle
may be out of the water, but that doesn't make it
any easier to get through. Is that a spiderweb? Spider? I don't see the spider. That means it's probably on us. It's on you. It's on you. I hate my friends. This cave is like a MrBeast video. The further you go, the harder
it gets. Just straight up. If we didn't have Joel, I'd be dead. And after three hours,
Joel had some bad news for us. The water is too high,
and we've taken too long. We're gonna have to turn around
for today and head back to camp. I disagree. You can't disagree
with the safety expert. I disagree. Well,
we can't really disagree. It turns out we wasted
way too much time filming and playing with flares, to the point
where we now had to restart and attempt
this mission another day. Shawn, we're back. What'd you do while we were gone? Hopefully nobody gets wet now. - I didn't even know we packed lights.
- Yeah, they're awesome, right? Sadly, we only made it 20%
through the cave today. But mark my words, we will go
the distance in a future day. - I doubt it.
- That's not going to happen. We might rest on day four
and then on day five, try to go all the way to the end
of the cave and see what's there. Day three was a lot of fun. I'll see you guys tomorrow. And after a third
miserable night in the cave the next morning,
we only had one thing in mind. A hot shower would
literally save my life right now. Oh, showering would be awesome. I haven't showered in three,
four days. As you can imagine, showering inside
a cave isn't easy. We had to hike all the way back
to where we rappelled in to safely reach the riverbed. Oh, no.
Oh my God. I feel my brain. I've never felt my brain like this. My forehead is frostbite. Let's use the drone to dry our heads
off. - Come here, drone.
- Stop, stop! It's actually working.
Yeah, it is working. Who needs a hairdryer 
when you have a drone? And after we dried off, we sat down
with Joel to plan our journey. - What is this, Joel?
- This is the map of the cave. Last time we had to stop
because of the fast moving water. But the rains have been slowing, so we might just get a window
to reach the end by tomorrow. This is going to be wild. First, we'll need to pass some of
those same rapids from yesterday. Dive off massive
cliffs and avoid jagged rocks. And if we can make it past all that, we will finally make it
to the beautiful glowworm chamber. Don't tell us what that looks like. - I want us to be surprised.
- Do you think we're going to make it? No, let's not play that game. 
We're all going to make it. With tomorrow's plan 
thoroughly mapped out, we've rested up and made Feastables
s'mores to regain our energy. Everyone cheers! Joel's about to have 
his first Feastables s'more. All right, Joel, be honest. That's good. - Joel approves?
- Joel approves. Why didn't we whip this
chocolate out earlier? This just got, like,
ten times more fun. Guys, for real, if you've never tried s'mores
with Feastables, you're really missing out. Tomorrow we're going to explore
the entire cave. We'll see you guys then. So we tried to sleep
as much as we could and prepare for tomorrow's journey
to the end of the cave. We're about to embark on one of the
most dangerous journeys of my life. Because of our experience from day
three and focusing less on filming, we were able to make progress way
faster. Ooh, this water's cold. Just like the other day, bro. Nice bro, easy. And to ensure our best chance
of survival. In addition to Joel, we brought
another survival expert with us. This is where we had to stop on day
three. How are we doing? We're making much better time! Behind us, it's pitch black. 
Where do we go? This area gets narrower,
the currents strong. So we're going to use the walls
and gonna climb our way along. So here we go. Oh, God. Yeah. Jump to that first rock, There's a couple of good
rocks around the corner as well you can get a hand onto. - It's so dark down here.
- There's no bottom right now. My feet aren't touching
the ground right now. Because we couldn't
reach the ground. This meant that if we let go now,
we could get swept away by the strong current
directly beneath us. Joel, what are we doing? I would go into here if you can. That's a good one. I can't even see where I'm going, Joel. The current is taking me away. How do I do this? You've got to get yourself in there
and it's going to get way gentler. - I go in here?
- Yeah, in the hole. Yeah! Well done. This might be the most
insane thing we've ever done. We are much deeper in the cave
than we've ever been. And we're now approaching
our first serious obstacle. Basically, the water's
recirculating, so if you fall in, it takes you to the bottom
and it keeps you there. If we fall, we would die. - Yeah. 
- Okay, so death is on the table? This is just not what I thought
I was signing up for. Well done. Yeah! Over! - So now I put my foot here?
- Yeah! Correct. - Oh, yeah. 
- Woo! Caving is a lot harder than I thought. You can tell how strong this river is 
because it created this entire cave. And fun fact, 
we're not as strong as a cave. I'm barely as strong as a human. Well, fortunately for us,
rather than Karl leading this expedition,
we've got the literal avenger, Joel. And just to prove
how much of an expert he is, this man literally
flexed on us by jumping off a cliff. Oh my god. You're crazy. Who else is a bit crazy? Surely one of you guys are keen. I'm crazy. No shot, you want to do that. What are you talking about? I'm doing it right
now, baby. Let's go, Joel. Godspeed, Mack. After everything Jimmy's put me through, this ain't that scary for me. Three. Two. One. Are you doing it? No. We've got to keep going 
or we won't hit the end. Oh my God. We go downstream? Why are we always fighting
the current? I might just start drifting away.
I might just give it up. There are sharp rocks underneath the water. You cannot see them. So watch your step. - Oh my God. 
- It's getting deep again. I can't, I need to put my feet on
something. And if the sharp rocks
weren't enough of a challenge. It seems
like with every step we took. Bro! I can't see anything. This is terrifying. The caves became darker, tighter and ruthless enough
that we began to question if we could even get
to the finish line. This is exhausting. This cave is about to get a lot harder. And I have something I need to show
all of you. Joel, can I see your bag? Thank you. You know what you've been carrying? What have I been carrying? The brand new... MrBeast Lab Swarms. I'll be honest, guys. As you can see, because of what I've
been going through for the past five hours, I'm clearly in no shape
to tell you about this right now. And so, a month
after we filmed this, I built an entire cave set
threw on my Future Jimmy name tag, and then said: hey, Future Jimmy
here, and I'm going to tell you about my brand new toy line
up, MrBeast Lab Swarms. It's a collectible
toy line with over 119 uniquely designed characters
that you can collect. And the coolest part is to find out
which character you got. You pour water into this tube,
shake it up, and the swarms will appear
in front of your very eyes. And to demonstrate the product,
I made this giant life sized version of the swarms tube,
fill the tube with water. You won't need this much water. This is just a giant tube.
All right. And now that this is filled
with water, Mack's going to give it a little shake. Is it shaken up enough? I think it's shake it up enough. Then you pour out the water.
Do the honors, Joel. And out of the water
will be revealed. which two swarms you got. This is the rarest one,
the hyperchrome. That I only made a thousand of. Joel, you can have it. - You can have that one.
- Who does Karl get? I only have two. If we didn't
just stop with the swarms. We also made
these action figure panthers that are in these briefcases
and this mutator that, just like the swarms, has a really cool reveal
when you buy it. Where do I buy them? I'm glad you asked, MrBeast's Labs Toys are now available
everywhere in the world you buy toys. They're all out now. 
Go give them a try. And after more brutal trekking
throughout the cave, we finally arrived at the glowworm
chamber. Man, this better be worth it. All righty team. Welcome to the glowworm chamber. Holy crap! That is crazy. Dude,
this does not look like it's Earth. All of the lights you see here are actually created
by tiny bioluminescent glowworms. That kind of looks like 
the Milky Way galaxy. At this moment, this view
honestly made that trek worth it. While making it to the glowworms 
was definitely worth the trip, our journey was still not over because we had to go
all the way back to base camp. It's almost day six. They're not back and I'm exhausted. I don't know
if I'll be able to sleep though, just worried with them being gone
so long. The trip back is way easier because we're just floating
with the current. Now, because you guys
have already seen the trip, we're going
to expedite the way back. But seriously,
this whole journey took so long. We crossed into day six
before reaching camp. Shawn. What's up guys? I was starting to get worried. Happy day six Day six. Let's go. All we had energy to do
was thaw out by the fire and finally eat some food. That was a very adventurous day. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Or later today,
it is day six. Yeah, maybe today, 
I don't know. Despite being physically obliterated
from our excruciatingly long hike, no matter what I did, I was
really struggling to fall asleep. I spent seven days in solitary confinement, seven days buried alive, 
seven days on a raft. And I'm going to be honest, I think
this is harder than all of those. You're constantly soggy and cold. I just keep hitting my body
on these hard of rocks and it hurts. 90% of the time
this cave is miserable. But between me and you... - Jimmy!
- Yo! Karl, can you see me? That's the world's
brightest flashlight. There are moments of fun
in this cave. From conquering rapids
300ft underground. With me and the boys
laughing in our hammocks. All the misery is worth it. Because when you're in good company. Let's make whale noises. This wet, cold, rocky,
miserable cave can easily transform into the most
beautiful trip of our lives. We cannot
leave until everything is picked up. And when I say everything,
I mean everything. Let's get out of here. And after our journey
back to the mouth of the cave. Oh, it looks so good up there. We had one more surprise for Joel. Before we head out, Joel,
as a show of gratitude. We got you 50,000 New Zealand dollars. So it's ten grand for every human
you didn't let die. Oh, gosh. Thanks so much, Jim. Let's go. Joel! We love you, Joel. Now that we got that out the way,
let's leave. After seven
long days, we're finally leaving."
I Built 100 Houses And Gave Them Away!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkCXLABwHP0,576.0,en,"In this video, we are building
and giving away of 100 houses, and each home is going to change
a family's life. Like this family
who didn't have a house to call their own. And they have no idea
we just built them one. Take off your blindfolds and turn around. Behind you is your brand new home. Oh, I was not expecting that reaction. She is freaking out. There's a bedroom!!! I've always wanted him to have a bunk bed. And my dream come true. This is actually just the first
of 100 houses we're giving away. First? I'm glad they're happy. Let's go give away another house. With every single home
we're building in this video, we're improving quality of life
for families who don't have a safe space to call home. And we spend millions of dollars just on this video building these houses. Because here in Jamaica, there are
currently over half a million people living in unsafe,
life-threatening conditions. Like this next family whose house is so unsafe
and unstable it could collapse on them at any moment. - So you built this place?
- Yeah. - By yourself?
- Yeah. I brought boards
and all materials that you see. But we're on top of a mountain. So you carried all this material
up this mountain? - Yep.
- On my head. We knew we wanted to build
this family a house. So we sent them on a trip
so that we had enough time to work with our partners
to build them a brand new home. You're about to witness a family
that lives in this house, go to living in this house. And I cannot wait to see
the look on their faces. Oh my. What you're looking at
is your brand new home. The trip we sent you guys on
was just a decoy so we can have time to build
this brand new house for you. Do you want to see the inside? Come check it out. We noticed that
you might need some new furniture, so we completely furnished your new place. Now, on top of the electricity, you have a water tank for running water. We put bunk beds in this room
for two of the kids. Oh my. And if you go across the hallway,
you'll see your bedroom. - Nice.
- With a little crib. Because I heard you had a newborn. Tyra, that's your crib. It's been really hard.
And you guys changed my life. Here's officially the deed to the house. Thank you guys so much. And it's unfortunate,
but some of the places these families live are extremely unsafe
and in some cases, life threatening. That's where this family currently lives. The mom was telling us that
that roof doesn't work. Whenever the rainfall,
whole place flooded all over here. Her kids get soaked and can't sleep. And as of today,
that will not happen again. We built that brand new home for you. - Here's the keys.
- Oh my God. I got a new house. But of course we couldn't stop there and we were able to build a home
after home for families in Jamaica. And we weren't going to stop
until we had built 100 houses. But unfortunately, at our next
destination, there's a river that destroys hundreds
of homes every year. During rainy season, this river flash
floods washing away all of the homes and anyone unlucky
enough to still be inside. And as you can see, there's literally a fridge right there, which I assume got there
because their house got swept away. Exactly. So you're saying when this floods
those houses that currently have families
living in them are going to be destroyed by this river? Yes, they will. Well, not on my watch
because just a couple miles away, we've built rows of new houses
for this community. No joke. We're giving away this home,
this home, this home, this home, this home,
this home, this home, this home. There's a lot of homes. So we started with Maria and her daughter, whose previous home was
completely demolished by the river and during rainy season. And without even a bed to sleep in, every single
day has been a struggle for them. God has helped me to stay strong. All right, since they don't speak English, Can you translate for them to turn around
and look at your brand new home? Can you turn around? Here is your new house. Oh my God. - Thank you.
- Thank you my beautiful God! Mommy! - Thank you.
- No problem. Come check out the inside.
Oh, you want to give me a hug? Come on. Oh! How beautiful! And while walking through their new home, we realized they didn't even
know the house was free yet. - Oh, you haven't told them it's free?
- No, no. - Yeah. Tell them. It's free.
- You're not gonna pay. All of this is yours. Thank you god! Congrats on your new home. You're crazy for not
telling them it was free. - Can I lay down? -
- Yes, you can lay down. I'm going to sleep. What do you think of it? - Can I give you a hug?
- What'd she say? - Can she hug you?
- Of course. Thank you! This is why we do videos like that. - Look how happy they are.
- I appreciate this with all of my heart. I don't want you to have to worry
about the river anymore. This is your brand new home. Enjoy the new home, little man. We heard they had a newborn,
so we also got him a crib. Son, we have a house. See that row of houses behind me with the family's
blindfolded in front of them? We are not kidnaping the families. We're giving them all houses
at the same time. Eight families
lives are about to change forever. Attention everybody. Remove your blindfolds and turn around and look at your brand new home. Congratulations! For real? It’s free? Thank you for the house, Jimmy! I got to go down.
I need to see the reactions. - What do you think of the new place?
- Thank you. Congrats. Can you ask them
if they like their new house? - Do you like your new house?
- Yes! Yeah. You like the new house? Let's see if they do.
What do you think of it? - Very beautiful! Thank you!
- Thank you! I hope you like it.
And now we're at the end of the row. - What do you think of your new home?
- Very good. Can I get a picture? Yeah, come over here. I have something way
better than just a picture. Can you ask him if he
wants to play football with me? Wanna play soccer with him? - Yeah.
- Well, that's convenient because... not only are we giving
this community houses, but we're also giving them
this giant soccer field. And the best part is, I have
hundreds of kids waiting over here. We're going to surprise them. And this is the neighborhood's first
look at their brand new soccer field. Let's play some soccer. Enjoy your new soccer field. Go have fun. And of course, a new field had to come with brand new soccer equipment
for all the kids. Make sure you guys have a lot of fun
on the soccer field. But I don't know
if the soccer field was enough because all of the kids
started demanding Feastables. Feastables! All right, here's some Feastables. They really love Feastables here.
I will start carrying more Feastables. Feastables is better than Hershey's! I don't know what he said, but if you said it tastes good
that he's correct. But of course, outside of this community, more families across El Salvador
were in need of safe houses. So on our way out, we built
as many houses as we possibly could, but we're only halfway there
because a small community in Argentina needed our help, and we built house after house
to ensure that every single child in this community
had a safe place to learn and grow. But we still weren't done. So we even flew all the way over
to Mexico, where we continued to build house after house
for all of these communities. And when we arrived
in our next destination in Colombia, we found a community whose homes
were ravaged by a brutal windstorm. The next family used to live
in a house like this. I say used to
because a tornado destroyed it. And clearly
these houses are in no way livable. And so of course we built John
and Ana a brand new home. And now all we have to do
is give it to them. This family has no idea they're
about to get that house. Right there is good. Okay, take them off. Congrats. I know it might not seem real,
but this is legitimately your house. You want to unlock the front door? They're all in shock. And to be honest, I don't even think
they believe this is their house. They may not be saying anything,
but the tears say a lot. Congrats man. Congrats. This is yours. It's so big. It’s so big! Before, we only had a
half finished room! We have a home! We have a home! But John and Ana weren't the only ones
that needed help in Colombia. So you probably already know What we did
for the rest of this community. Don't you love it? Look at that smile. It shouldn't be a stretch
that everyone in the world deserves a safe roof over their head. But not every house we built
went quite so smoothly. I accidentally broke the lock to the door. Their furniture's still outside,
which we are going to move in there. The family just pulled up. We put bars on the
window so I can't get in. - I don't really know what to do.
- We're very screwed. All right guys, the family's here.
It looks like we're out of time. No way! Are you serious? Hey, how's it going? Come on over. Okay, so, I don't know,
I think I broke the lock. I can't get the door open. Here, can you try? Maybe I'm just dumb. Oh, what? Wait, how'd you do that? Are we dumb? All right boys, come on in. And while personally,
I'm not quite the best locksmith... Do you want to see it? They totally haven't
seen any of the furniture yet. What mattered most is that Jose and
his family now had a place to call home. You don't have to worry
about a home anymore. And we also heard their only means
of transportation broke down. And so, one more surprise. We also got you guys
a brand new motorcycle. Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you.
- No problem. Yeah. Now they have a brand new home
and way to get around. And this got me thinking. While giving away all these houses, I noticed a lot of people were
struggling with transportation. And I got a solve in this truck. Open it up. We got bicycles for every single
one of the kids in this village. - Thank you, MrBeast.
- No problem, man. - Thank you, MrBeast!
- Thank you, MrBeast! After all of these houses
we built in Colombia, we still had one home left to give away. And finally, house 100. Take your blindfolds off
and look at your new home. - Thank you!
- Congrats. - Oh, congrats.
- Thank you very much. Go check it out. Shout out to all our partners
that helped build these houses. And also shout out to you guys because obviously
if you didn't watch these videos, we wouldn't
have been able to build 100 houses. And if the channel continues to grow,
I hope to do 1000 in the future."
In 10 Minutes This Room Will Explode!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv0iVoSZzN8,600.0,en,"I just started this ten minute timer and
when it hit zero that room all the way over there,
full of money will explode. And the only man that can stop it
is this man in this straight jacket. This video is completely real time. You'll notice it's exactly 10 minutes long. There are no cuts.
You see everything. And if Darcy does not escape
his jacket and get through all five floors of
this tower and press that button before the timer hits
zero, his money explodes. All right, he's coming down. Okay,
this is our first ever real-time shoot. - I got to go quick.
- Get in here, let's go. Go, go. 
Hey, hurry, unhatch this. Wait, how did he get out of that jacket 
so fast? It doesn't matter. This next
floor is twice as hard to escape. Slower, slower, slower. Holy. You put fire in there? Okay,
so to get out of that metal cage, you need to use the lock pick 
on the floor, hurry up. - Faster! 
- Darcy! Come on. Come on. Oh my gosh, come on. Even with a tool,
picking a lock takes some fidgeting. He has to perfectly align all three pins
inside the lock in order to break free. By the way, in order to prove this video 
is 100% real-time. starting now, you're going to see 
an unbroken shot of Darcy in the corner of the full video. And as of now, a minute has gone by
and he's still in the first room. And remember, he still needs to get through all five floors of this tower
and press the button in time... The button's right here. ...to keep his quarter
of a million dollars from exploding. I'm getting so much anxiety. Please go faster Wait, Mack, he's picking the lock. Is he making good time or not? So now, yeah, But he's about to go down
to an even more difficult room. Be careful. Don't catch a fire. Darcy, go. - Go! Go!
- Come on, what are you doing, bro? go. He's coming down the rope, he's in the glue room now. Welcome to floor number four. Come on. He's already made it 
to floor four. This is floor number four. - Ok.
- What is it? So this entire floor
is now covered in glue. He has to choose between monkey barring
or walking across the glue. And I would very much advise
he does not walk across the glue. So far so good on the monkey bars. Keep going, buddy. Come on. - Come on, Darcy do it!
- Let's do it. Two minutes has gone by. Go on your head, man. Oh, no. Why are you spinning? 
Stop spinning. If he falls, that is not good, because that is the stickiest
glue in the world. I'm not even joking,
he'll lose his shoes. Oh, yeah. It's already been 2 minutes. Dude, he's swinging. 
He didn't touch the ground once. The man is glueless.
He made it to the exit. Oh, yeah. He's about to lift up that lid. And now he's about to enter
the craziest room. Keep taking us down. Watch this. You're going to see him
jump down. Oh my God, boys, I'm so tired. Oh, Darcy's struggling, but he's making his way down 
the rope onto floor three, the boulder room. This one should be pretty simple. All right, Darcy,
See that giant boulder? Yes. Well, these two ropes are the only thing
preventing it from barreling down the ramp. There's also a machete. and let's just say 
you'll need it to get out of this room. You're losing time. what do you think you'd do with the knife? - I'm trying to cut these ropes.
- Cut that rope. You're running out of time. Normally in our videos, when someone 
does something this slow, we cut it out, but this is life. We literally can't cut it out.
I am freaking out. Seven minutes remain. He's almost through the first of two
ropes. This is like some James Bond stuff 
right here. As he goes lower, the floors are
going to get harder and take longer. He's actually not making as good
pace as you would want him to make. That rope is going to take him
the longest because of how thick it is. Cut the rope. - He's wasting a lot of time on this.
- He's behind right now. This knife is so dull. You're going to have to hurry. Under seven minutes remain 
before your $250,000 explodes. Bro is still cutting the rope. Jimmy, what's going
to happen here? When he cuts that second rope? Something crazy is going to happen. And Darcy, what do you think 
is going to happen when you cut that rope? All right, I guess Darcy's locked in. Jimmy, what is going to happen
when he cuts the rope? This boulder is going to go, 
I guess, through the window. - Tell me, please,
- All you need to do... - Yes.
- Is hold onto that when he cuts the rope. Okay, That's. That's. I can handle that. There's no way I'm losing this 250
grand because of this stupid rope. Jimmy, why did you find the slowest
man possible at cutting a rope? Darcy, hurry up. Like I told
you at the start, this is real time. You're seeing everything. Obviously,
Darcy's pretty occupied right now, but if you could talk to us,
he'd probably tell us about the fact that he's a world
class escape artist, but apparently is not the best
at cutting ropes. Darcy, you spent a whole minute on this. Oh, my God. Cut faster, come on. Bro, you have got to cut 
the rope a lot faster. Oh my gosh. Oh, he's about to finish the last
rope. Darcy, push the boulder down the ramp. So, the boulders is going to... - You'll see in a bit.
- Okay. He's pushing the boulder now. - Brace yourself.
- What the... Back up. - Keep going.
- What? Darcy, quick, 
grab that rope from the ceiling and attach it to the latch
on the front of your pants. Make 100% sure that it's connected. What is he going to do? All right, now, jump down. Step out to the edge
and turn around. - All right.
- Watch this. Watch what? Am I going to have to jump, Jimmy? Oh my God, he's about to jump. Go to your right.
Go to your right. What is he going to do? - What is he doing?
- He is about to jump. All right, Darcy,
you're going to have to jump down. Oh my God, how am I going to do this? - Let's go, Darcy.
- Darcy, jump. What the... Okay. He has exactly 5 minutes left. Stop the crane. Stop the crane, stop the crane, stop the crane. All right, I don't know, 
the crane operator is drunk. You got to make it through
the lasers. This floor is by far
the hardest yet. Not only does
he get to make it through this laser maze, if he accidentally touches a laser, his money will instantly explode. How am I going to do this?
There's so many lasers. While he's doing this laser room. I'm going to tell you guys about
T-Mobile, my new wireless partner. In here? - Mack.
- What? You probably know T-Mobile
from this coverage map. - Yes, I do. I do.
- But here's the thing. Okay. You know,
great coverage is to be expected. Okay. But what T-Mobile has 
that other carriers don't... Jimmy, he's halfway
through the lasers now. Oh, he's on our side.
But what makes T-Mobile special is they have something 
called Magenta Status. Okay. What is Magenta Status? It's where they treat
you like a VIP. Just by using T-Mobile, 
you can get a reduced cost at hotel rooms, you can get free in-flight Wi-Fi, 
access to VIP lounge. - Go, go, go.
- All right. T-Mobile, I'm stressing out. Sorry if I'm forgetting 
lines and a bunch of other stuff. - And the best part is, Mack...
- It's right there, Jimmy, yes. - Yes, let me finish the T-Mobile ad.
- Okay. And the best part is... 
He's jumping in the water. It's all available. Day one,
when you switch to T-Mobile. So, if you're not currently using T-Mobile,
start using now. You can get all these perks 
literally today. Let me just catch my breath here. See how at tmobile.com/status. Oh, he's in the water. Oh my God. All right, this is it, 
the last level. He now has to open the four valves
in each quarter of the room, allowing all the water to drain, Then he can escape out
the front door and hit the button
to save his money from blowing up. You got to turn these. Turn these things? - Turn.
- Turn the knob. What's he doing? Actually, don't help him. Let's see if he's smart enough 
to win the money. Will he be able to hold his breath
long enough to unscrew all four valves,
or will he run out of time? Did the water come out? Hey, he did it. While this guy is doing 
this intense challenge, I want tell you about the greatest
tasting chocolate on the planet. Feastables. Mack. What do you think of Feastables? Oh, it's my favorite. Oh no, he's going for the one 
he just finished. Hey, hey.
No, no. Do the other one, do the other one. - You got to keep going.
- There's four. How much time is left? Oh, three minutes. Yeah. He actually kind of
just wasted, like, 30 seconds. He could do this if you just hurries up. Come on, catch your breath, let's go. Mack, he's about to go under, 
go around this side, see if it opens. He didn't do it yet. He didn't do it yet. All right, keep turning. - Oh, he did it.
- Other side, other side. - Oh my God.
- Two down, two to go, baby. All right. He's now making
his way to the other side. - You got to go swim down.
- Oh my God This is coming down to the wire. I cannot imagine how absolutely
exhausted he is right now. Ok. All right, so he has two minutes 
and 10 seconds to, right over here, press that red button 
or his money will explode. It's coming down to the wire. You got it. You got it. I don't know what to do. Normally, we do cuts and edits,
but this is like real time. Everything I'm saying is making it. - Oh, he's got less than two minutes. Bro.
- There’s just two minutes. - Hey, less than two minutes.
- Go faster. He's getting close, he's getting close. He got it. He just did it, he got all four. He did it. All right, the final door,
a minute, 50 seconds. All right, what now? Now he has to open this door, run
and press the button. - How much time does he have?
- Just under 2 minutes. How is he going to pull this off? I don't get it. You're going to get wet if you stand there,
you might want to back up. Why? Open it. There is so much more water 
that still needs to drain. - All right, Mack, hey.
- Go faster. Mack, in case he fails, 
that bomb will blow up, so I need you to just, hide behind 
the sandbags over there if he messes up, - Okay?
- Okay. Just trust me. What do I do? You have to unscrew all the latches. Get him out of there, come on. Almost a minute, come on, come on. Bro... I don't know if he's
going to make it at this point. The door stuck because there's
too much water pressure. He needs to wait for it to drain
more. Wait, Jimmy, the water is starting
 to come out the front door. Turn it, turn it, turn it and pull it. Pull it. You got to go, buddy. 
You've got to go. He's stuck in that one, 
he can't get it. Something's wrong. Bro, this is it. 
He's going to fail. He can't figure out
how to open the door. He literally has 45 seconds 
to hit this button. It stuck, come on. Bro, he can't get these latches off 
to save his life. Bro... What is he doing? Come on. Come on. You got 30 seconds, 
come on, come on. Go! You have to slide through the door 
and hit the button. Go faster. Go. Go! - Come on.
- Come on. Hurry, before the bomb blows up. - Yeah!
- Yeah! And after he won with 19 seconds left, we cleared 
the money out of the way the bomb, and asked him
what he was going to spend it on. I'm having a baby tomorrow. What? And then we blew the building up. Oh Gosh. I hope you enjoy the explosion. We have to make this video 
exactly 10 minutes. Goodbye."
Train Vs Giant Pit,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuhE6PYnRMc,636.0,en,"- I just bought this train and it is currently barreling full-speed towards that giant pit over there. We're also crashing countless cars, blowing up thousands of
sticks of real dynamite, and even putting 10 jet engines on a car. Just to show you the most
insane experiments of all time. Starting with filling a house
with over 100,000 fireworks. Please do not try this in your house. For this experiment, each of the boys will hide
a dummy in my new house to see if it's even possible to survive. - Water and fire don't mix, my mannequin is going to survive. - Mine's in the fridge. - Go in, come on. Let's blow this house up. Hey be careful. If you accidentally press
one, the house explodes. - Oh my goodness.
- Please. Where's your mannequin? - Bathtub.
- Fridge. - Under the washer. - Tareq?
- Front porch. - Oh yeah, it's sitting right there. This is gonna be the coolest thing you have ever seen in your life! - Yes! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - Fire in the hole! - Oh my God! - What happened to the house? I can't even see it anymore. - Oh my god! - I don't think our mannequins are gonna make it. - The house burned all night, until there was literally nothing left, including all the mannequins. Next experiment. We're about to play Tug-of-War between this real military tank and these two school buses. And the loser gets dragged into the pit. - There's no way the tank loses. - We're probably gonna lose. - No, we're not. - Now obviously, people
can't be in these vehicles, 'cause they'll die when
they fall in the pit. So this remote actually controls the tank. This feels illegal. 3, 2, 1. Go! - I'm full throttled right now. You're done for! Oh!
- Oh, we're screwed. - The buses are done for. Oh my god. - Oh my god! - Oh my god! - Do you hear the buses beeping? Its horn's going off. - We're gonna go investigate
the bottom of the pit to see the buses. - Oh god.
- Oh, no. I need to stop looking down this is... Stop moving!
- I'm not moving! - We're in the pit. Oh my gosh. Bro, look at that. Why'd the bus think it
could beat the tank? - I don't think it did. - Later in this video, a train's gonna come off those tracks and land right about there. But before we do that, this is $50,000, and it is surrounded by
thousands of pounds of TNT. And this is Will. - What's up guys? - See that crate in the field?
- Yeah. Oh, man. - That is around 1% of the explosives surrounding this money. - Are we safe standing here? - Uh yeah, you'll be fine. Here's my credit card. Spend as much money as you
want to protect this 50 grand. I don't care if you use wood, bricks, or even steel to protect this money. Whatever's left of this 50 grand when that TNT blows up, you keep. Good luck building walls. - All right, let's make $50,000! - I don't think he stands a chance. The first thing Will did was buy 12 industrial water containers and filled them with
20,000 pounds of water. - I'm really worried that Jimmy's TNT is gonna get through this. - And he should be, because this isn't even close
to enough to stop the TNT. Meanwhile, we're gonna
test another experiment. In a previous video, we
put a jet engine on a car and it jumped eight buses. So this time we put 10
jet engines on the car and we're to see if it
flies 10 times further. When this car flies off this ramp, I think it's gonna go past
all the buses into the trees. - I think it's gonna hit the first bus. - Our guesses couldn't be further apart. He's currently matrix-ed into the car, so he sees what the car sees. Chris!
- Hey! - Oh, should we move? - Yeah, we're sending a rocket car. - Oh, okay. - 3, 2, 1. Send the jet car! The car's coming straight at us. - I lost signal. - Maybe we should jump? - Now I'm straightening it. - Oh, my god! Yeah!
- What the heck? - Whoa! Wait, wait. We broke the ramp! - I think it was a success.
- Yes. The jet car easily cleared all 12 buses and literally left a crater in the road. I love how this block of engine's just on the road. - Yeah, it's still smoking. Whoa! - Oh, it's leaking.
- Oh, and it's smoking. - And now we're back at the giant pit. If you jump in this deep pit and land on a thousand bouncy balls, would you die? - I'd love to know. Nolan, catch! - Catch what? What are we doing? - Goodbye. Oh! Oh. - You completely missed! - Luckily we have more mannequins. Will it survive? Pay attention! - Oh. Oh! - Oh, buckets! - Hey Jimmy! What if we dropped the car in it? - I think you know what's about to happen. - Yo! - Clearly that mannequin didn't survive. Next bit. Meanwhile, Will was desperately trying to protect his $50,000. He's honestly taken
this way more seriously than I thought he would. - In the past four days,
I've hired some professionals and we've already built
the cinder block wall, filled it with matches, and we're already on our
second cinder block wall. This dynamite is not getting through. - You blew my expectations
outta the water. How about this? If you let me double the
TNT, I'll double the money. - So a hundred grand, double the TNT. - Yeah, but if it blows
it up, you get nothing. - Take the deal! Take the deal! - Okay! Okay!
- It's a deal baby! Deal baby! - And while he kept working,
the boys and I went bowling. And the bowling balls are these cars. - I'm ready to see some destruction. - Let's see if I get a strike. Hey, first bowl a strike. Oh, it's not going straight. - Oh, it's coming in our direction. We should move. We should move. We should move.
- Nolan, watch out! - Oh, into the field. There it goes. Oh it's turning around. - Oh, it's coming back! - Oh God.
- It's coming back. The car's got a mind of it's own! - It's coming back! - Take number two. Oh, that's a perfect strike. - Whoa! - Whoa!
- Let's go! - I love cars hitting things! - And if you're wondering, the other car is still going in circles. During this bit, me and the boys have been wearing some brand new designs, which you can now buy on our new store, MrBeast.store. 3, 2, 1. We switched from ShopMrBeast.com,
which was very long- - Move over! Move over! - to MrBeast.store. Oh, my gosh! - Ooh!
- No way! - Whoa! - We just about died. - I'm gonna show you how to
just hit a full strike easily. - Okay. - All right. Here comes a strike, baby. - A .store domain is the perfect choice for anyone looking to
sell anything online. - That was the worst throw yet. - That was the best throw yet! - That was awesome! - If you're looking to set up a store, it should be at .store domain, so your customers clearly know
that your website is a store. - This is Carl's car. - Unlike .com, MrBeast.store
tells the world that the website is my store. Oh. Don't forget to head to MrBeast.store and buy our brand new merch, right now. Since I doubled Will's money and TNT, he's completed a seven-layer fortress of 20,000 pounds of water, mattresses, a cinder block wall, four mattresses, a second cinder block wall, an additional 32,000 pounds of water, all packed in with a final wall of dirt. - But I actually have another layer that Jimmy knows nothing about. Jimmy will never see this one coming. - What? - Hey, Jimmy! - How am I supposed to blow up Feastables? - That's the point. - And with the TNT doubled, it's time to put Will's
bunker to the test. I also brought number 40,
from 1 throughout 100, back to help us blow up all this TNT. You're in charge of the button. Don't press anything yet. Oh god. Moment of truth. Whenever you're ready, press the one. I'm nervous. Whoa! - Oh my god! - Oh, that money's gone for sure. - Oh my god! - Bro, look at that smoke cloud! - I can't even see anything. Is it okay? - Wait, I think I see
money falling from the sky. - No! Seven days of work just went up in flames. I don't know if I've got this. I gotta see if my money's okay! - Why are we running? - I'm running 'cause he's running. - Oh my goodness! Oh, there's so many stacks! - We counted out the money and over $95,000 survived the explosion. - I just won $95,000! - Congrats on the 95 grand. Let's go see what happens if
you drive a train into a pit! - Yeah!
- Whoo! - And now's the moment
you've all been waiting for, a train is gonna go
full-speed down those tracks into this giant pit. If you were on this train,
where would you sit? - I put my mannequin in the cabin. Statistically the safest
place to be on a train. - All right, you got this. - All right, we're gonna
sit him right on the front. You're not going anywhere. - We're gonna give the
Feastables bar a front row seat. Stop eating Hershey's. Eat Feastables. We have waited our entire
lives for this moment. This is going to be epic. Nolan, send the train! - The train's coming! Let's do this! - Oh my god. Here it goes! - Oh my god, here it comes! - Oh, my god! - Whoa! Look at that! That might have been the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life. - Are you kidding me? - Yeah, my mannequin didn't survive. - Train versus pit, the pit won. I hope you enjoyed the video. Let's end it with an explosion. - Ooh! That is so hot! ♪ Mr. Beast ♪"

I Survived A Plane Crash,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdMNoQE3mIQ,494.0,en,"- I just bought this private jet. And now it's crashed. It takes on average 31
hours for a rescue team to find the survivors of a plane crash. And now me and the boys
are literally stranded in the middle of nowhere
until help arrive. All right, let's assess
the damage over here. - I see some water bottles. We're gonna get thirsty out here. You know how it is. - Oh, look, they really paid two pilots and they only need one? That's why your flight's so expensive. - Chris! - What? - I found snacks. - So just like a normal
plane, it's all terrible. We're saving these for later. We gotta ration this. - But I'm hungry now. - We're gonna pool the
plane resources on the wing. - This takes layovers to the next level. - The only food and
water we have to survive is what's typically
stocked on a private jet. These tiny planes really don't
have much food and water. I think it's time we use some strategy. Half of us should go explore the area, and the other half should
keep organizing the inventory and building a shelter. - All right, let's all
go grab plane pieces. - The longer we explore,
the less we have to build. - Exactly. - We push it and we're
making like a tent area. Uh-oh. - It kinda works.
- I like it. That's what we want. - What is the objective of exploring? - I don't think exploring does anything. - Oh, well, when you put it that way. Does this not look like a movie scene? - This feels like we're
in ""Jurassic Park."" - It really does. - Wait, especially with that dinosaur. - Oh, shoot. - Wait, is this our new home? This is epic. They made progress while we're gone. Doesn't look like there's much water. - I drink my four bottles,
which is my share. - You've been drinking waters? - I've been thirsty. - What happened to rationing? - I rationed these nuts. - Nice. - I'm a streamer, I'm not
made for this outdoor stuff. We've come back with so many sticks. Oh, it's scary in here now. Do you feel like you know
how to get back from here? I think we're lost. - Guys, I got a fire pit. Holy crap. Did you rip the engine off the plane? This is actually a perfect fire pit. You might not be the brightest,
but this is impressive. - I think I have enough wood to go ahead and get the firewood started. Look at that. - Chris is big braining right now, dude. - We are thriving, not just surviving. - I've got an idea. Tareq, give me the drone. Tareq brought this drone
to get cool drone shots. But what he didn't plan for is for me to tape the drone
and use it to scout the area. Bro, it's literally just trees. I wonder if Ludwig hears
this, then he's like- - He's terrified. - I hear a drone. - You do? - Is it more that way? This way. We might actually be lost. Karl! Chris! - All right. Still trees. Still trees. Wait, what is that? Oh, my God that's water.
- Hey, Chris! - That's water. Look what I found. - That's a river source. - Wait, where is this river? - Karl! - Is that Ludwig yelling? - Is that Ludwig?
- Hello? - Okay, Karl I'm having
fun with the drone. You go save Ludwig. - Ludwig just screams. - Karl! - Where is he? Is he in the forest? - Where are you? - Ludwig! - Karl! - Ludwig! - Karl! Karl! Oh my God. - Are you kidding? - That's like nothing. - These are good sticks. - That also wasn't even in the bag. - But I... - Watch yourself with that stick. - We need a meeting, Jimmy. Ludwig was lost in there and I find him with a bag
of about eight sticks. - Man, that's actually a lot of wood. - It's a good amount of sticks. - He was out there for an hour. . - Here's the situation. This plane wing can fall at any point, we barely have any water left, and we haven't even built that helipad for the helicopter to land and pick us up when the time's up yet. I know everyone's about to go to bed, but I just remember we have a flare gun. - Help! - Oh.
- Oh, wow. Wait, is it gonna come down? Oh, we're dead. Oh wait, nevermind. Another one! Ooh. Before you shoot our last flare, what if we actually need a flare? - Why would we possibly need a flare? - Apparently this drone
has a thermal camera. So we decided to test something
in the name of science. - Dude let me write a message in urine. - All right, we're ready? Write us a message in your pee. - I think I see it. - Yes, we see his pee! - You see it? I put my initials. - Yeah, we do. - We can see your pee.
- Oh my God. - I wanted to write, ""sub to MrBeast"" but I realized I was
gonna run out of fuel. - You don't have enough, yeah.
- Yeah. Oh, that's actually the first water bottle I've had in six hours. - Chris, are you hungry? - What do you think, Tareq? What kind of question is
that? Of course I'm hungry. Not anybody has ate. - We're not even halfway
through the challenge and we're starting to go
crazy due to dehydration. - The only thing in the air right now are these bugs. - Guys, I just realized we're gonna miss our connecting flight. - Guys, I just realized we're probably gonna miss
our connecting flight. - I'm not having fun anymore, bro. - This is taking lay over
to a whole new extreme. - It's 4:00 AM, I've gotten no sleep. It's freezing cold outside. I've gone from heat
exhaustion to shivering in like six hours. - How'd everyone sleep last night? - On the wrong side of the plane. - It got really cold
in the cave over there, so we all came over here
and slept by the fire. - How much food do we have left? - None. - We have like 10 packs of nuts. - Is that the only thing?
- Literally only peanuts. - As you guys remember when
I was playing with the drone, we saw a river over there. And see now we need to shower
and none of us have water minus like, Ludwig. - I drink my four bottles. - I think we should go find the river. - To the river. ♪ Going to find a river
through the woods ♪ You guys gotta remember
I grew up in woods. The roots have been washed out by water, that means we're getting close. Guys, I think I hear it.
- Yeah. Chris, the river did
look closer on the drone. - We're almost there. - You guys wanna hear my Chris impression? ""Yo, it's right through here, guys."" - I am actually seeing
like little purple dots and I don't know if it's
gnats or I'm dehydrated. - I wouldn't drink out of this river - Boy, fishing poles. - Oh. - We did not put those
there, just to be clear. I don't think this is
ever gonna be clean enough to drink and bathe in. - No. - I have a headache and dehydrated. Chris is just gonna keep going. - We keep trekking off. - I think we just head back to the plane and just leave them. - Shower would have been nice, though. - Oh, what? Why in America's there just
random things in the woods? - Whoa. - How old is this Mountain Dew? - Whoa. - Oh my God. This thing's disgusting. Oh, there's wasps in here. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. - All right, let's jet, let's jet. - I got you. - Oh, we brought bug spray. - Run! - I've never been so excited
to get back to a crash site. - We're back! - Do you hear yelling? - I hear yelling. - What are you a river God? - I am a river God. That's why I have this staff. It gives me plus 18 intellect. You guys been being productive? - Chris, you're back. - Chris, who's that? I'm the river God. - I'm severely dehydrated. They need to pack more waters on plane for when you get in a plane crash. This is really hard to survive
off of like this much water. How does this compare
to 24 hours in a desert? - During the day was
hot, but we had water. - How does this compare to
50 hours in the wilderness? - This is way harder. - Because in the wilderness
one, we had water. - Almost like you need water to survive. - Is there actually a
helicopter coming or not? I don't actually trust that
there's a helicopter coming. - It's officially been 30 hours, which means we have one more hour until the helicopter saves us. I have three layers of sunscreen on, four layers of bug spray. But that aside, we should build a place for the helicopter to land. - Go a little faster,
we've only got an hour. - You wanna do it? - Why do I have to mow the grass? - We could burn the grass, 'cause then it'll just be a bare path. Now, theoretically, we should be able to burn the grass inside of where we did
the fire extinguisher. - This is a terrible idea. - So how are you making the H, Chris? - I'm using fire. - Fire! I took care of it. - I think now we're
burning an obvious place for them to land. - Bro, we ran out of water 10 hours ago. - I'm just excited to go
home and take a shower. - What? Come on, you had fun. Did you not? - It was a good time. - What?
- Exactly. - With the exception of the lack of food, the lack of water, the lack
of shower, the lack of sleep. - I'm tired. - It hurts to breathe. - I haven't had a drink in five hours. - Chris, are you hungry? - What do you think, Tareq? - Oh wait, do you guys hear...
- I hear it. - Oh my God. - I hear it. Oh my God. - We gotta let him know where we are. Oh. - Hey! That's our rescue helicopter. That means that 31 hours is officially up. Here.
- Here. - Right there. - On the H that I made. - Yes! Look at the trees!
- Oh my God! - Whoo! 31 hours in that stupid plane. I'm out here. Goodbye. I'm gonna go get some
water and take a shower. - We're Going Home! We're Going Home! - That just took layovers

I Cleaned The World’s Dirtiest Beach #TeamSeas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV2gBU6hKfY,295.0,en,"- This is one of the dirtiest
beaches in the entire world. And we're gonna pick up
every single piece of trash on this beach. Starting with this water bottle. One out of millions of pieces of trash. - We did it! - This will take forever. [upbeat island music] - Bottle me up, baby. I'm hungry for your plastic. - As you can see, this is taking forever. Oscar, come on in. This is Oscar, professional beach cleaner. Is this basically how
you guys clean beaches? - Mainly, we do the big stuff first and then we bring a lot of
people with sifters as well for the small stuff. - You scoop it into this thing and then shake out the sand, and you got a bunch of trash. This right here is the first bag of trash. Hundreds more to go. How
do we do this quicker? - We just need more people. - That seems simple. Can you clap for me? [Oscar clapping] There you go! All the volunteers. (crowd cheering) - Okay guys, we're gonna
clean this up using the vice. We're gonna clean this up. Groups of four! Groups of four in this area. - Part of me wanted to
see if me and the boys could clean up this beach by ourselves, and the other part of me realizes that would've taken a year. - I could've told you that. - Jimmy! - [Jimmy] Yeah? The ocean's putting
more trash on the beach. There's so much underwear in the ocean. - I'm enacting a new law. Thou shall not throw your
underwear in the ocean. - Wait, did you guys
already fill up a bag? - Yeah. - You guys are better than us. They are professionals to be fair. (upbeat music) - After 12 hours of cleanup, this is what we managed to
achieve, which isn't enough. Boys, bring it in. Tomorrow, I'm gonna bring
in 10 times the volunteers. Tomorrow. (record scratching) (flip-flop squeaks) - Tomorrow. - It's now the next day. (crowd cheers) (upbeat music) - I'm helping. - Nah, nah, nah. - But as slowly as possible. - Who's more bueno? Mark Rober or MrBeast? - MrBeast. (piano music) - Make sure you watch
until the end of the video to find out how we're gonna pick up 30 million pounds of trash. - Thank you for coming to our country and help us with this initiative. That is really awesome. (upbeat music) - Right here. Right there. Stop. He's not stopping. I'm gonna move. In this bad boy is 6,000 pounds of trash. And now we have 36,000 pounds of trash, which weighs the same as
3,000 cats or three T-rexes. Whichever you prefer. While I was talking
with some of the locals, they mentioned that there's
a beach down the street that was also very dirty. So I said Nolan with a bunch of volunteers to go clean that beach as well. There's a whole car bumper right here. - There's a car bumper here?
Did this come outta the ocean? - People litter weird things. - What type of trash have
you seen along the beach? - Most importantly, most
commonly is plastics. And we see that in every
form on the beach here. - They ended up removing
12,000 pounds of trash, which brought us up to a total of 50,000 pounds of trash
from just two beaches. - Check out this power move. Watch this. Look at that! - Is that how you want us to dump it? - Yeah, dude, I'm taking one for the team. I'm a team player. Oh yeah. I don't even have to look. - There you go, Mark. - It actually kind of works. - See? - And if you guys look over there, we're actually getting close
to the end of the beach. This is what the beach looked like at the start of the video. And this is what it looks
like with like 20% left. We're getting there. - We're doing it! - Unfortunately, between
the ocean washing up trash to the beach and rivers
bringing in new trash from the mainland, obviously this
beach is gonna get dirty again. But with your guys' help, we
can stop a much bigger issue. - We're almost done, Jimmy. - I know! Four straight
days of picking up trash. And just like that, we removed
over 60,000 pounds of trash from the world's dirtiest beach. And even though this 60,000
pounds of trash we picked up might seem impressive, there is sadly way too much
trash still in the ocean. Two years ago, we crushed
our goals with Team Trees and planted 20 million trees. - And now it's time to do it again. - Which is why we, along with
hundreds of other creators, are launching Team Seas. And for every $1 you
guys donate, like this, one less pound of trash
will be in the ocean. - But what if I wanted
to donate $10, Jimmy? - I conveniently have 10
pounds of trash right here that is now out of the ocean. - Boom. Gone. - You get the point. One dollar donated as one less
pound of trash in the ocean. And I'd like to personally
thank YouTube Originals for supporting Team Seas
and helping us fund it. They're gonna be matching
the first $400,000 worth of donations, dollar for dollar. And we wanna remove 30 million pounds of trash from the ocean. - Which is just so freaking audacious. This only happens if we all work together. - Half the money we raise is going towards funding volunteer beach
cleanups like we did here today, all across the world, as well as literally fishing trash out of the ocean. - And the other half
will be used for these trash-eating robots that
pick up trash 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, from rivers
that flow to the ocean. - Go to teamseas.org or
click the donate button below this video right now. $1 equals one less pound
of trash in the ocean. Making real change like
this isn't gonna be easy. Go donate right now and help
us remove 30 million pounds of trash from the ocean
before the end of the year. Let's show the world that
we want a clean ocean. (soulful music) - What are you doing? Get outta here. Go donate.

How far have you traveled in your lifetime? - Fabio Pacucci and Lindsay DeMarchi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZdF9qo7IA,339.0,en,"Happy 100th birthday! Your favorite granddaughter
(shh, don’t tell the others) created a surprise: a holographic map displaying everywhere
you’ve traveled— not just on Earth,
but through the universe! While you haven’t literally been to space, you've lived on a spinning rock hurtling
around a sun, whizzing through a galaxy, and the journey only gets
wilder from there. You’ve made some real progress
in the grand scheme of things. But... how much, exactly? Your atlas starts on the planet’s surface. Over the course of your life
you’ve walked about 120,000 kilometers— the equivalent of three trips
around the globe. Daily commutes and international travel
add a few more. This may seem remarkable until you factor
in your pirouette around the planet each day due to its rotation. The distance traveled this way differs
from person to person— those close to the poles trace a
smaller circle than those at the equator. Living halfway between them you’ve picked
up 30,000 kilometers every day without shifting a muscle. Except, your motion isn’t
perfectly circular. It's a curlicue. As the Earth elliptically orbits
the Sun, there you go, adding roughly another
940 million kilometers every year. But it doesn’t end there. Our entire solar system is contained
within the heliosphere, a bubble of charged particles
emitted by the Sun. That bubble orbits the Milky Way’s center,
which harbors a supermassive black hole, at a speed of about 200 kilometers
per second. One full orbit takes 230 million years— meaning we've aged little more than one
galactic year since the first dinosaurs. In your 100 years, you’ve witnessed
four ten millionths of one rotation. That’s still 600 billion kilometers, or 2,200 round trips
between the Earth and Sun. Our galaxy and over 100 neighbors together
constitute “The Local Group.” The Milky Way and Andromeda are hurtling
towards each other  at 125 kilometers per second, and will collide in about
4.5 billion years. The Local Group is a speck
within the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself just one of many lobes
of the Laniakea Supercluster that contains over 100,000 galaxies. This supercluster has a mysterious
gravitational center  called the Great Attractor. Because these enormous masses
all gravitationally tug on each other, our galaxy’s motion is much more
helter-skelter than a clean, circular orbit. In your lifetime,
you’ve traveled 2 trillion kilometers at about 600 kilometers per second
relative to the Great Attractor. The Laniakea Supercluster is,
you guessed it, moving with respect to everything else
in the universe. At every step thus far, your granddaughter
has used central reference points to describe your relative motion.  But the universe has no center. Instead, astronomers use the Cosmic
Microwave Background, or CMB, an echo of the early universe, 
which involves low-energy photons bouncing around everywhere
in all directions, all the time. Imagine standing somewhere where
the wind blows toward you at the same speed from every direction. If you started running any which way, the wind in your face would
have a higher speed, while the wind at your back
would be gentler. The CMB is like that— any direction we travel, the CMB appears
more energetic or blue-shifted, while behind us it appears red-shifted. By measuring the degree
and direction of that shift, we can determine where we’re going
and how fast, relative to the CMB. And the answer is:  630 kilometers per second
towards the Great Attractor. To recap: you’re spiraling around a sun
circling a supermassive black hole, hurtling towards another galaxy, chaotically weaving around a supercluster,
and barreling out into the great expanse. Yet you’ve felt none of that; tucked as you are into your planetary
spaceship by gravity’s embrace. If you drew a straight line from the point
where you were born to where you are today, it would measure about one fifth
of a light year! That may not sound like much, but neither does hiking through a park
or sitting through a sunset. There’s wonder to be found at every point
of our all too brief journeys."
Why did it take so long to find giant squids? - Anna Rothschild,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1aZxcyiYAw,335.0,en,"In 1873, two fishermen off the coast
of Newfoundland glimpsed what they thought
was a submerged shipwreck. But when they probed the mass, it moved— and huge serpentine appendages
soon besieged their boat. One fisherman took an axe to the animal,
and it disappeared in a cloud of ink. What remained were two long limbs— definitive evidence in a collection of
clues that would only continue to grow. Over time, it became clear that giant
squids were more than mythical monsters. People found sizable specimens
washed ashore, caught in nets, and at the sea’s surface, and observed sperm whales
with sucker-shaped scars and large beaks in their stomachs. But it wasn’t until recent decades
that scientists actually found living giant squids
in their natural habitat. So, what do we really know
about these creatures? Well, interestingly, one thing we've
gathered is that they might not even be the biggest squids out there. There are hundreds of squid species
inhabiting almost all parts of the ocean, ranging from the size of a thumbnail to more than seven times
the length of a human. All squids are carnivores and
share the same basic body plan, including a muscular mantle that covers
their internal organs, a sharp beak, eight arms, and two tentacles
specialized for capturing prey. The smallest squids eat things
like tiny shrimp, while larger ones can feast on fish
using their powerful beaks. The Humboldt squid’s bite force,
for example, is strong enough to shatter Kevlar plates. And the suckers on the giant squid’s long,
clubbed tentacles are encircled by sharp,
teeth-like protrusions that help them grip prey like
deep sea fish and other squids. Giant squids live in the cold, dark,
high pressure twilight zone. It's extremely unlikely you'd
ever encounter one, since you'd be very out of
your depth down there. We don’t know exactly why
giant squids are so big— but the phenomenon fits with a pattern
of deep-sea gigantism, where certain deep-sea species dwarf
their shallow-living relatives. Perhaps because food down there is scarce, large animals that can cover more ground
and store more food are favored. Giant squids’ size could also give them
an anti-predator advantage, while the deep’s cool temperatures help
them manage their metabolic rates. Innovations over the past 150 years— from dredges and bathyspheres to untethered and remotely
operated submersibles— have enabled peeks into the deep. And yet, it wasn’t until 2004 that researchers actually saw
a giant squid in its natural habitat. Then finally, in 2012, scientists lured
a giant squid and got it on video. They used a stealth camera system
fitted with a device mimicking a bioluminescent jellyfish
under attack. The system had no thrusters,
keeping it unobtrusively quiet. And it only projected beams of red light—
undetectable to most deep-sea dwellers. Both encounters revealed that giant squids
are not sit-and-wait predators, as previously suspected. Instead, they’re active hunters that use
their basketball-sized eyes to stalk their prey before projecting their tentacles and 
snatching animals up to 10 meters away. But many questions still stand. We know sperm whales eat giant squids, but it’s unclear how fierce the fight is and if the squids ever stand
much of a chance of escaping. Extrapolating off the number of giant
squid beaks in whale bellies, one estimate placed the global giant squid
population at around 4 million. It seems they mate when a male injects
sperm packets into a female’s arm— but exactly how they find each other
and what happens after are uncertain. Giant squids are globally distributed, but they’re mostly missing
from the planet’s polar regions, one of which happens to be where another
humongous squid species lurks: the elusive colossal squid. Far fewer specimens have been collected, and they’ve yet to be seen
or documented in their habitat. But we know they’re from a completely
different family than giant squid— evidence that gigantism independently
evolved more than once among squids. Their limbs are shorter
than giant squids’, but their mantles are larger,
making them up to twice as heavy. And unlike the giant squid’s
toothy tentacles, colossal squids have hooked,
swiveling sucker barbs. Much remains mysterious
about these animals. But we know they’re down there,  guarding their secrets
in the deep, dark sea."
What’s the best way to treat the common cold?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQWmagZmogQ,333.0,en,"Throughout history, one persistent ailment has inspired
a variety of treatments. In ancient Egypt, doctors used
incantations and breast milk remedies. In 18th century Europe,
bloodletting was a popular choice. And when President Calvin Coolidge
was afflicted in 1924, his ill-advised solution was inhaling
poisonous chlorine gas. These are just a few of history’s
many creative attempts to soothe the common cold.  Today, pharmacies are filled with a
seemingly mountainous assortment of cold remedies. But how do these products work?
And are they effective? While colds are caused
by a variety of viruses, their nasty symptoms aren't actually
produced by the viruses themselves. Rather, they’re the result of your body’s
natural defenses. When a virus is detected, white blood
cells release proteins called cytokines, which recruit more pathogen-fighting
immune cells to the area. To aid in this bombardment,
blood vessels widen, and it's this inflammation that leads
to a blocked, stuffy nose. The body dials up mucus production in an
effort to trap and expel pathogens. But this mucus can irritate
and inflame airways, causing coughing and a sore throat. Since the viruses causing
colds are so varied, pharmacy products aren't designed
to attack viruses, but rather to alleviate the
most common symptoms. So which pill, syrup, or spray
should you choose? Or should you ditch the pharmacy
and try a home remedy? It depends. Most pharmacy products
contain a painkiller, in addition to one or several
other active ingredients, or those mystifying chemical names
stamped onto the packaging. While there are over a dozen
cold-related ingredients available, most fall into one of four 
symptom-fighting categories: if you’re sick of dealing with the 
mucous-y mess oozing from your nostrils, you may want to take nasal decongestants,
like pseudoephedrine. This snot-fighter,
found in pills and syrups, promotes the release of norepinephrine, a chemical messenger that
reduces blood flow to the vessels in your nasal passages. This frees air and fluid so that
you can breathe more easily. Cough suppressants aim to quell
those torturous coughs. Dextromethorphan, one of the
most common suppressants, addresses the head of the command chain, moderating brain regions
responsible for coughing. While it’s not fully understood how
this ingredient manages to quiet coughs, we know it interacts with receptors
that neurons use to communicate. Drugs like ketamine and PCP
engage similar receptors, which is why it’s important to take
dextromethorphan as directed, as high doses are notorious
for causing hallucinatory effects. But not all coughing is bad
when you have a cold— expelling mucus can help
clear out infectious debris and ease uncomfortable congestion. By lubricating airways, our third class
of ingredients, expectorants, aim to help improve coughing
rather than eliminate it. Guaifenesin, the most common expectorant, is thought to hydrate mucus by upping
fluid secretions in the respiratory tract, making it less sticky
and easier to clear out. Finally, we have antihistamines. As advertised, these inhibit
the effects of histamine, the chemical messenger
behind allergy symptoms. While histamines aren't involved
producing cold symptoms, studies suggest many antihistamines
can still help dry a runny nose. Benadryl, for example,
contains diphenhydramine, which blocks both the effects
of histamine and a neurotransmitter which regulates the flow of mucus
in our airways. Unfortunately histamines also regulate
wakefulness in the brain, so many of these drugs can
make you drowsy. In this fight against cold symptoms,
there’s still a lot we don’t know. Since these ingredients don’t attack
the viruses themselves, it’s unclear if any
speed up your recovery. Further, many were first introduced
to the market decades ago, when studies were less rigorous. So, scientists continue to reevaluate how
well each ingredient relieves symptoms. Similar questions remain
around holistic remedies. Many people use zinc, but research
on its effectiveness is inconclusive. And while vitamin C has many benefits, the value of taking large doses
to fight a cold is likely overhyped. Yet studies suggest that honey
can improve cough and may even shorten your illness
by a day or two. Who knows what the future
of cold treatment will look like. Until then, better understanding these
products can help you choose the right ones for your symptoms— and know which remedies can best
reduce the sting of a nasty cold."
The deadliest thing in your kitchen - George Zaidan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKgXBjkKI_E,288.0,en,"Avocados may seem innocent, but these oblong fruits sent almost
9,000 people to US emergency rooms in 2018 alone. Injuries sustained by hacking at the pit
or slicing while holding the fruit have become so common,
doctors have dubbed them avocado hand. Of course, there is a safer way
to cut avocados. But knives are just one of the hazards
kitchens harbor. In the US, between 2011 and 2022,  the deadliest kitchen appliances
were ovens and ranges— appliances that are stoves
and ovens in one. They took lives by causing fires
and leaking carbon monoxide, a gas that can cause suffocation
at high concentrations. These kinds of sudden, catastrophic
fatalities are thankfully rare. But the kitchen dangers that
cause the most casualties may actually be less immediate
and more gradual— involving constant exposures,
like stuff in the air we breathe. Ovens and stoves remain
a major culprit here. Indeed, the fourth leading cause of years
of life lost globally is air pollution. This includes indoor air pollution,
most of which comes from cooking. Over 2 billion people cook using a solid
fuel, like charcoal and wood. As it burns, fire and oxygen can’t reach
all of the fuel source, leading to incomplete combustion. This produces pollutants like soot,
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and lots of particulate matter— that is, solid and liquid particles
that have become airborne and small enough to inhale. A single particle can contain
many different chemicals. And especially tiny particles can
penetrate deep into the lungs, enter the bloodstream,
and irritate tissues, cause inflammation,
and bring about more systemic problems. It’s estimated that about 3 million people
die prematurely each year from illnesses caused by burning
solid fuels. Stoves and ovens that don’t use solid
fuels produce far less pollution— but still a considerable amount.  There are two basic types:
gas and electric. Gas stoves primarily burn methane
to create an open flame for cooking. Traditional electric stoves use metal
elements that radiate heat when an electrical current
is forced through them. They’re different from modern
induction electric stoves, which use electromagnetic waves
to induce currents that heat iron and steel
cookware directly. Gas stoves pollute more
than electric ones. That's because natural gas combustion
produces byproducts like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and formaldehyde. Unravelling the causes of chronic diseases
is incredibly difficult, but accumulating evidence suggests that
gas stoves exacerbate asthma symptoms and put children at increased risk
of developing the condition. Electric ranges are cleaner than gas ones, but they’re still not totally
pollution-free— no ranges are. At least some air pollution is inevitable
from the cooking process, no matter the fuel type.  High-heat cooking generally releases
more pollutants than lower heat methods; after all, charring a steak isn’t all that
different from burning a solid fuel. And substances like oil and dust
can accumulate and release pollutants when heated. Transitioning away from solid fuels is
critical to improving indoor air quality— and consequently,
extending people’s lives. Cooking with proper ventilation— ideally, from a powerful range hood
that vents to the outdoors— and switching from gas to electric
will also go a long way. Electric appliances are less dangerous
by another significant metric: the global climate. Burning fossil fuels like natural gas  releases atmosphere-warming
carbon dioxide, and gas ranges can also leak methane,
an even more potent greenhouse gas. Electric appliances, meanwhile, should only become more and
more climate-compatible as grids transition to renewable
energy sources. In addition to being better
for the climate and public health, electric induction stoves tend to rival
or outperform all other stove types— electric and gas— when it comes to cooking
efficiency and ease of cleaning. Induction stovetops also only heat things that respond strongly
to their magnetic fields, so you can’t burn yourself
on them directly. Given the considerable health and
climate concerns around gas appliances, some governments have banned
them from new developments and many are helping subsidize
the transition from gas to electric. Knives will probably be staying
the same, though, so please stop stabbing at avocados
while they’re in your hand."
How do animals regrow their limbs? And why can't humans do it? - Jessica Whited,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uTmcG7CgdI,328.0,en,"For some animals, losing a limb
is a decidedly permanent affair. But for salamanders,
particularly axolotls, amputation is just a temporary affliction. Not only can they grow back entire limbs
in as little as six weeks, they can also regenerate heart
and even brain tissue. So how does this astonishing
adaptation work? Regardless of regeneration, every limbed creature had to grow
their arms and legs at some point. And whether that process starts
in the womb or the world, it almost always begins
with little bumps called limb buds. These buds are full of progenitor cells— a cornucopia of cell types that can
differentiate into various tissues, including muscles, cartilage, ligaments,
and tendons. Some of these progenitors are stem cells, capable of developing into a range
of specialized cells and tissues, while others are merely derived
from stem cells. But in either case, the progenitors
differentiate and multiply rapidly as the limb bud develops. Nerves grow into the limb
from nearby cell bodies and a network of blood vessels form
which fuel the process with oxygen. Eventually, that tiny bud grows
into a full infant limb. Most salamanders, including axolotls,
develop their limbs in the same way. But unlike other animals, they can also
start this process all over again if they need to.  When salamanders lose a limb, surrounding skin cells
quickly surge across the wound’s surface. This new layer of skin is called
the wound epidermis, and once established, it signals cells
in the underlying limb stump to undergo something
called dedifferentiation. This process reverts nearby cells
from fully developed limb tissues back into earlier, less specialized
progenitor cells. At the same time, the peripheral nervous
system fires up stem cells throughout the salamander’s body. This would be impossible
for most multicellular organisms, whose stem cells typically lose their
regenerative capacity with age. But when salamander stem cells
near the injury get the right signal, they reactivate and start multiplying. Researchers don’t know what ratio
of stem cells and dedifferentiated progenitor cells
regeneration requires. But we do know these cells come together to form the most important part
of the process: the blastema. This structure is almost identical
to a limb bud— the primary difference is that it’s
made of recycled, repurposed cells, and potentially reserved cells,
rather than completely new ones. Beyond that, blastemas and limb buds
have the same mission: to make thousands of new cells
and organize them into the muscle, bone, skin,
and nerve tissue required for a functional limb. As this process unfolds, nerves and
blood vessels spanning the injury site transmit nutrition and oxygen. Over several weeks,
the stump will steadily grow a miniature limb with translucent skin. And when the process is complete, not only will the limb match
the rest of the salamander, there won't even be a scar. The relationship between scarring
and regeneration is just one of this processes’
many mysteries. Scientists are still tracking
salamander cells on the molecular level to determine how they revert from a
mature stage into a regenerative one. And research into transplanting
blastema cells investigates how other animals might replicate
this reconstructive wizardry. We also don’t understand how
salamanders’ bodies know what part of the limb has been lost
or how much needs to be regrown. One theory is that blastema cells have
a form of positional memory, allowing them to determine how much
to grow in relation to one another. And it’s equally important to understand
how these limbs know when to stop growing to prevent overdevelopment,
like in cancerous tumors. But one of regenerations essential
ingredients doesn’t belong solely to salamanders:
the blastema. Deer antlers use a similar healing
tissue to regenerate each year, even though their skin scars like ours. Spiny mice can also restore skin, hair,
and some other appendages scar-free. And even humans can regenerate
the tips of our fingers and toes in a surprisingly similar manner. We still don’t know whether
this ability is tied to our shared ancestry with salamanders or fueled by distinct
biological mechanisms. But with time and research, who knows what evolutionary knowledge
we might grow back."
What does appendix pain feel like? - David R. Flum,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CUEPNcGtWs,338.0,en,"In April 1961, the Sixth Soviet Antarctic
Expedition took a harrowing turn. Doctor Leonid Rogozov,
the team’s only physician, began feeling weak and feverish, with an excruciating pain
in his right side. After a few days, it became clear
that he had appendicitis, an infection that can cause
the appendix to burst. And Rogozov knew that if his appendix
did rupture, it would likely kill him. Outside a blizzard raged, making it dangerous for him
to leave the station, or to have anyone else travel in. So Rogozov faced a gut-wrenching choice:
wait for help that may never come, or cut open his own abdomen
and remove the appendix himself. While Rogozov’s predicament may
have been extreme, appendicitis is not uncommon. It affects roughly 1 in 12 people. So, what causes appendicitis? And why is this organ
so prone to bursting? The appendix is a small, worm-shaped pouch
attached to the large intestine that houses a diversity of gut microbes. Scientists long speculated that it was
a useless artifact of evolution. Recent evidence shows that this organ
independently evolved  in many different mammals. This suggests that it
probably has some function, though it's likely subtle. One possibility is that the appendix
serves as a reservoir for healthy gut bacteria,  or it may play a role
in mounting immune responses. What we do know is this puzzling organ
can cause serious complications. Most cases of appendicitis start
with some sort of obstruction. For example, a small, dried piece
of stool, called an appendicolith, can lodge itself in the organ’s entrance. Other times, pathogens like viruses or
parasites activate the immune system, causing inflammation.  This immune response may
even be triggered by one of hundreds of species of bacteria that normally reside in your gut. As a result, nearby lymph nodes swell, effectively closing off
the appendix’s opening. Because the appendix is a closed loop,
when it's sealed, pressure builds quickly. This creates the perfect environment
for bacteria to colonize and overgrow. As the inflamed appendix bloats,
discomfort sets in. And this pain is different
from your everyday stomach ache. It typically starts near the belly button and then migrates to the lower right
abdomen and intensifies. If left untreated,
the appendix can continue to stretch, hindering blood flow
and weakening the organ walls. Eventually, this can cause
the appendix to rupture, allowing the infection to spread
within the abdomen, where it can pose fatal consequences. Thankfully, not all cases of appendicitis
will lead to a rupture, but it's impossible to know
exactly when or if the appendix will burst
from symptoms alone. So, it’s recommended that all people
with severe abdominal pain seek immediate medical attention.  Since doctors first identified
appendicitis in the late 1800s, an appendectomy, or the surgical removal
of the appendix, has been the standard treatment. It’s normally performed quickly,
within 24 hours of diagnosis. Doctors remove the inflamed organ,
which can double in size, either through one large incision, or through several smaller incisions
using a camera and small instruments. Recovery is typically quick, and most patients are discharged
within a day or two. Though, if the appendix has burst,
surgery can be more extensive as any bacteria and pus need to be
thoroughly cleaned from the abdominal cavity. In the long term,
living without an appendix is unlikely to lead to any health issues. Today, thanks to medical advances,
many patients avoid surgery altogether. Doctors have learned that appendicitis
can often be treated with a simple course of antibiotics, started in the emergency room
and continued at home. No matter the chosen course of treatment, it’s likely to be less distressing
than Rogozov’s, who, after giving himself
local anesthesia, removed his own appendix,
stitched himself up, and resumed his regular duties
just two weeks later. Nevertheless, thanks to his story, doctors on remote stations in Antarctica
now know to bring plenty of antibiotics to treat appendicitis,  just in case."
The surprising reason zebras have stripes - Cella Wright,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJB0nmEjbDY,355.0,en,"When an English aristocrat rode
through London in a zebra-drawn carriage, he embodied a dream decades in the making, borne from European efforts to dominate
the African continent. But 19th century European colonists
faced big problems as they tried to control the sprawling
African territories they’d claimed, one of which was biting flies. These pests could extract half a liter
of horse blood daily while transmitting fatal diseases
that devastated domestic horses, leaving colonial powers reliant
on thousands of humans to transport goods. Zebras, however, appeared immune
to the same pitfalls as horses. The German Empire deemed them “predestined
for the use of military needs,” and undertook the task
of domesticating them. Around 1900, former German colonial army
officer Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorff placed himself at the mission’s helm. But he severely underestimated
the project. And soon enough, the question of why domesticating zebras
was proving so difficult joined another longstanding mystery: namely, why zebras had such
conspicuously striped coats— a matter that perplexed
prominent scientists— and went on to fuel decades of debate. To understand zebras’ more
distinctive qualities, we should start with the big picture. Zebras belong to the same family
as horses and donkeys. After their lineage entered Africa, they evolved into the three zebra
species that exist today, living in social herds in eastern
and southern Africa, grazing on grasses
and evading fierce predators. Scientists have speculated extensively
about zebra striping, but not all theories have held up. For example,  the hypothesis that striping has a social
function seems unlikely because, while every zebra does
have unique patterning, other equids have no trouble identifying
individuals in their herd without it. Some have theorized that the pattern helps
zebras stay cool in direct sunlight, with the heat differential
between their black and white stripes generating cooling air currents. But when scientists tracked the air
movements around sunlit zebra hides, they saw no such effect.  Many have also wondered if the patterning
works as camouflage or somehow confuses or dazzles predators— perhaps evoking a tangle of tree trunks or creating uncertainty around where
the zebra’s body starts and ends. But hyenas and lions probably see zebras
as gray until they're in close range, where they can also hear and smell them. Lions can likely also identify their
outlines just as easily as they can other, less flamboyantly patterned prey. And given how frequently
lions capture zebras, it doesn't seem like they're
all that confused. One hypothesis that does
pack a lot of promise concerns those biting flies
that horses couldn’t handle. Zebras have shorter hair than other
grazers in their regions, possibly making them more vulnerable
to the flies’ probing proboscises. So, perhaps striping somehow
acts protectively. Testing this hypothesis, one experiment found that a certain kind
of biting fly avoided horses covered in striped
and checked rugs, compared to those in solid grey. Another documented biting flies
circling horses, zebras, and horses clad in zebra print equally— but landing on zebra-y areas
only about a quarter as much. Biting flies also generally approached
zebras at higher speeds and didn't decelerate as usual,  causing clumsy overshoots
and crash landings. It seems that zebra stripes—
and other graphic patterns— interfere with how biting flies
process visual information to position themselves when landing, limiting their blood-sucking
and disease-transmitting opportunities. But zebras aren't just good at keeping
biting flies off their backs. Around 1900, Bronsart founded an
experimental ranch near Mount Kilimanjaro to capture and cross-breed zebras
with other equids. Things didn’t go as planned— in part because zebras have a robust set
of defensive fight and flight adaptations. Most are capable of running
within an hour of birth, and they’re equipped with fierce bites
and kicks strong enough to kill a lion. Bronsart’s operation was also unprepared
to meet zebras’ needs. Those Bronsart did gather, which he
paid Indigenous people to wrangle, couldn’t produce enough milk
for their calves. Within a single year, Bronsart had burned
through a five year budget and dozens of the zebras he held
in captivity were dead. Attempts at zebra domestication
had failed miserably, leaving those rare instances of zebra
taming largely to black-and-white history."
Are you more likely to explode or freeze in space? - Tejal Gala,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuc6bXxgvh8,296.0,en,"Due to an unfortunate
teleportation malfunction, this mad scientist has just found himself
in the vacuum of space. With no oxygen, he might be tempted
to hold his breath, but this would only accelerate his demise. The air in his lungs is
desperate to expand, so if he doesn't release it right away,
his lungs will rupture. Our poor professor quickly exhales, and his skin’s tensile strength prevents
the rest of his body from bursting, but things are still looking grim. Without surrounding air pressure, his bodily fluids begin to vaporize
in a process called ebullism. His skin swells, moist surfaces
like his eyes start to boil, and bubbles form within his vessels,
obstructing blood flow. This is all exceptionally painful, but while these nightmarish effects
will take roughly 90 seconds to reach their deadly conclusion, he’ll mercifully pass out
from lack of oxygen within about 15 seconds of arriving. And even though space is barely
above the temperature of absolute zero, our scientist won’t die by freezing. Because unlike on Earth, where body
heat can transfer to molecules in the environment,  in space it can only leave
by slowly radiating away. It'll take hours before our professor
becomes a human popsicle, and by then, he’ll have perished
a long time ago. Now, had our scientist planned
his teleportation to space, he certainly would have dressed
for the occasion. Let's imagine he arrived
in a spacesuit instead. The suit’s pressurized air protects
his body from ebullism, its oxygen tank keeps him breathing, and the insulation prevents
him from freezing. But although these features thwart
an immediate tragedy, space is still an incredibly
dangerous place. Outside the shield of Earth's atmosphere
and magnetosphere, our scientist is bombarded
by galactic cosmic rays— a form of radiation believed
to come from distant supernovas. If he's exceptionally unlucky, he might be hit by solar energetic
particles expelled from the Sun. Both these forms of ionizing radiation effortlessly pass
through the scientist’s suit,  damaging his DNA
and increasing his risk of cancer.  But let's say our mad scientist
isn't so mad at all. He’s planned a month-long
research expedition, complete with a cutting-edge
spacecraft to live in. This structure protects him from low
air pressure and temperature, as well as some of the radiation
bouncing around space. But even here, he's vulnerable
to certain changes. In addition to experiencing motion
sickness and sleep disturbances, microgravity changes the distribution
of his blood and cerebrospinal fluid, shifting roughly half a gallon
of internal fluids to his upper body. As the weeks pass, his brain engorges
and the sheath of his optic nerve swells. This not only compresses his pituitary
gland, but flattens the back of his eyes, impairing close distance vision. Having very little gravity to work
against also causes muscles and bones all over his body
to gradually lose mass. And when bones break down,
they release minerals like calcium. So our professor might get
kidney stones too. Diet and exercise can help reduce the
deterioration of his bones and muscles, but it’s harder to address the
potential damage to his mental health that comes from being confined
to a tiny spacecraft, far away from his loved ones. Thankfully, this isn’t a one-way trip,
and after a month in space, our adventurer happily teleports home. However, his journey has left him
with some lasting effects. Back under Earth’s gravity, it’s initially
hard to stand without fainting. It takes a few days for his fluids
to redistribute back to normal, and it'll be months before his muscles
completely regain their strength. Meanwhile, full restoration of bone
density will take at least a year. His vision might take several
years to recover, and it may never return to normal. There’s still a lot waiting to be
discovered about how space travel impacts human health
in the short and long term. So for now, our scientist is content
to use his teleporter for its original— and much safer— intended purpose."
The tale of the boy who tricked a tyrant - Paschal Kyiiripuo Kyoore,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtjHHnu_IB0,281.0,en,"Shock seized the West African Dagara
village as word traveled of a new decree. Completely disregarding
time-honored naming rituals, the tyrannical chief declared that,
going forward, he alone would name
the village’s children. But an unlikely challenger
eventually appeared... One day, a mother was taking her newborn
to the chief’s house to be named when her baby asked where they were
going from his crib. She told him, and he responded
that they could return home because he already had a name
and it was Yagangnaa, meaning “wiser than the chief.” So, they did just that. Years later, while hunting lizards
near the chief's house, a friend called Yagangnaa’s name,
which caught the chief’s attention. He knew he hadn't given any child a name
that insulted his own authority. When he asked Yagangnaa who named him,
and the boy replied that he named himself the chief grew furious. He committed himself
to proving his superiority— and punishing Yagangnaa’s family. First, he called on Yagangnaa and gave him
a huge basket full of millet and pebbles. He told Yagangnaa to have his mother brew
“pito,” or millet beer, by the end of the day, so the chief
could entertain his farm workers. Upon hearing the chief’s orders,
Yagangnaa’s mother wept. It was impossible to separate
the millet from the pebbles. And everyone knew it took
weeks to make pito: the millet had to be soaked, dried,
ground, boiled, then fermented in days-long stages. So, Yagangnaa decided to retaliate
with another insurmountable task. He sent the chief gourd seeds
and asked him to prepare calabash cups that same day to hold the pito
his mother was making. The chief would have to wait
for the seeds to germinate and the plants to bear fruit, then
harvest, carve, and dry them— the work of an entire farming season
all in one day. Realizing Yagangnaa was onto him—
and one step ahead— the chief ordered him
to return the millet. Next, he instructed Yagangnaa to look
after his bull until it produced enough cattle
to fill his kraal and pay his sons’ bridewealths. Without protesting that he’d need a cow,
not a bull, to do this, Yagangnaa agreed. The next day, he began cutting dry
wood near the chief's house. When the chief asked what he was doing, Yagangnaa said he needed wood
to cook and warm his house because his father had
just delivered a baby. The chief laughed and said
that was impossible, to which Yagangnaa asked why
it should be impossible for his father to deliver a child if the chief thought his bull
was going to produce cattle. One-upped once again, the chief ordered
Yagangnaa to return the bull— and decided to take extreme measures. He told Yagangnaa to accompany his son
on an errand and provided him a beautiful horse
and expensive clothes. Meanwhile, the chief's own son wore
tattered clothing and rode a weak horse. Sensing the chief's new trick brewing, Yagangnaa offered to trade
with the chief’s son, who agreed. But the chief had given
his men grisly orders. And moments later, a poisoned arrow flew
towards the well-dressed boy on the beautiful white horse, striking and killing the chief’s son
while Yagangnaa escaped. Ever fixated on eliminating Yagangnaa,
the defiant boy who named himself, the chief invited him over for
a pito drinking spree. He dug a well and covered it
with a cowskin to create a deceitfully decorative seat. But, by now, Yagangnaa knew
the chief’s plans, and dug a tunnel connecting his house
with the chief’s well. Later, when Yagangnaa arrived
and graciously took his seat, he fell into the pit.  The chief ordered his wives
to pour hot pito into the hole. But Yagangnaa swiftly escaped
through the tunnel and asked his mother to collect
the pito that soon followed. The chief thought he’d finally succeeded— until receiving a message from Yagangnaa
the next day asking to reciprocate the
chief’s generosity, inviting him for pito. Realizing that Yagangnaa had
outwitted him again, the chief conceded. And finally he abolished his decree and returned the power of naming
back to his people, where it belonged."
How do bulletproof vests work? - Max G. Levy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsaSaYcnTKg,316.0,en,"By 1975, Richard Davis had been shot
in the chest at close range 192 times. But not only was he completely healthy, each of these bullets had been shot
by Davis himself as part of a demonstration
to sell his new product: the bulletproof vest. Playing with firearms
is always a bad idea, but after testing his design
on empty vests, Davis became convinced that taking
a bullet himself was the only way to prove the vest’s efficacy. And when people saw Davis walk away
with just some stinging pain a minor cut,  they may have stopped
questioning his sanity and started wondering how such
a light, flexible piece of clothing could stop a bullet. The secret was in the material: a synthetic fiber invented
a decade earlier by a material chemist
named Stephanie Kwolek. Her employers at DuPont had found
huge success with nylon, the world's first synthetic fiber, and they wanted Kwolek to create
something even stronger they could use to mass produce
durable, lightweight tires. Like all synthetic fibers,
nylon is a polymer: a long chain of repeating molecules,
or monomers. While some polymers repeat
the same monomer over and over, others chain multiple monomers
in a steady pattern. It’s these two variables— which molecules are involved
and how they bond to one another— that give each polymer
its unique properties. So, seeking to build on the
strengths of nylon, Kwolek began a lengthy process
of trial and error, combining various monomers in novel ways. And one of these resulting polymers was
immediately very weird. Named Kevlar, this alternating blend
of 1,4-phenylene-diamine and terephthaloyl chloride combine
at the molecular level to form a series of parallel chains. At rest, these chains align
in strict rows, giving the polymer order
and crystalline strength. But when pressure is applied,
the chains wriggle around, allowing the material to flow
like a liquid. This so-called liquid crystal polymer
was unprecedented, and when Kwolek’s team spun
the viscous fluid into a fiber, the results were better than
they could have hoped. Not only were the fibers flexible
and resistant to heat, acid, and various chemicals,  when woven together,
they were also stronger than steel. Metals are incredibly sturdy because
of their unique atomic bonds. Where non-metal molecules are typically
held together by the attraction between a nucleus and a set number
of electrons, metal nuclei are surrounded
by a sea of shared electrons. It takes a ton of energy to overcome
the strength and resiliency  of these countless bonds. So when a bullet hits a steel plate, the material can usually absorb
all the impact’s energy before the metal is pierced.  Compare this to a bullet hitting wood. The bonds holding wood together require
much less energy to break, which is why bullets can travel much
further through wood than metal. Kevlar’s atomic bonds are also weaker
than metal’s. But it compensates with a huge number
of hydrogen bonds. While not as strong as the atomic bonds
within molecules, the attraction of hydrogen atoms
and oxygen atoms between molecules also requires a huge amount of energy
to overcome. And when threads of Kevlar’s polymer
chains are woven into fabric, this strength is multiplied. When a bullet hits Kevlar, the mesh
of highly aligned, liquid-like chains absorb huge amounts of energy, wiggling wildly while still clinging
to their neighboring chains via hydrogen bonds.  And even if a bullet does have enough
energy to penetrate the Kevlar, it would be moving considerably slower
with much less destructive force. Of course, Kevlar is not
immune to everything. Strong forces can still be felt
through the fabric, and its fibers gradually lose strength
under ultraviolet light. Additionally, new liquid crystal fibers
hold up better against acid. But Kwolek’s invention remains
one of the most versatile and widely used materials on Earth. Today, companies rely on Kevlar’s
lightweight impact resistance and durability in helmets, kayaks,
spacecraft, and automobiles. Speakers sometimes use Kevlar because
it can push air efficiently and quickly come to a dead stop
when you pause your music. And yes, it also makes excellent tires."
Why did people wear powdered wigs? - Stephanie Honchell Smith,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl1i6RtM4o8,341.0,en,"In 1624, 23-year-old King Louis the XIII
of France was in crisis. He was balding. What would people say, at a time
when a monarch's hair  had come to symbolize
his power and nobility? Louis was not interested in finding out. Instead, he made a decision that kicked
off a 150-year fashion craze: he wore a particularly full wig. Long before Louis people adopted wigs
for various reasons— including hygiene, theater,
and anti-aging endeavors. Wigs date at least as far back
as ancient Egypt, where well-regarded hairdressers crafted
them into intricate styles. And under certain ancient Roman dynasties,
women's wigs became particularly ornate, one poet mocking their numerous tiers. During the Middle Ages, the Catholic
Church discouraged wig-wearing, emphasizing instead humility
and austerity. So, those who did wig
in medieval western Europe generally wore more
natural-looking styles. But as rules relaxed in the 1500s,
wigs became more acceptable accessories. Queen Elizabeth I of England
owned over 80 red wigs, which she used to augment her hair
and conceal it as it thinned and grayed. One of these wigs even adorned
her funeral effigy. Yet it wasn't until Louis XIII unveiled
his magnificent mane a couple of decades later that
big wigs truly began booming. Members of Louis' court,
perhaps eager to gain favor, bewigged themselves and aristocrats
elsewhere soon followed suit. The fast-growing popularity of wigs
might have been accentuated by concerns over hair loss
caused by mercury, which doctors then prescribed to treat
syphilis and other ailments. But people also heralded wigs
as convenient, since they eliminated the need for daily
hair cleaning and styling. In the mid-1600s, the trend amplified
under Louis XIII's son, Louis XIV. At the time, Europe took its couture cues
from Madrid. But Louis XIV's government changed that by investing heavily
in France's luxury industry. They created specialized guilds,
formalized seasonal releases, enforced a dress code at court, and banned imports that could have been
made in France or its colonies. Louis XIV once even ordered his son—
yet another Louis— to burn his coat because it was made
of foreign cloth. Buoyed by its growing colonial empire, France amassed wealth and influence,  and Parisian-style big wigs soon
perched atop many European heads. These full-bottom men's hairpieces
demanded such thick, long locks that ten heads of hair
could go into just one. Within a century, the number of Parisian
wigmakers quadrupled. Even small villages often boasted
at least one wigmaker. They generally fabricated their
merchandise from human hair— probably sourced from poor women— or from cheaper materials like wool
or horsehair. To clean their wigs, eliminate odors,
and absorb sweat, people showered them in perfumed powders
of flour, chalk, and aromatics like violet, rose, clove, and lemon. It was a messy business,
with entire rooms designated for the task. In fact, that's where the term ""powder
room"" is thought to have originated. By the mid-1700s, men's wigs remained
popular but became simpler, often styled with curls around the face
and a ponytail in back. Women's wigs, however,
soared to new heights, literally towering up to a meter. Wigmakers often constructed these using
rods, ribbons, and wool stuffing. And once covered with hair, the wig could be adorned
with all manner of accoutrements. Lighter colored wigs became fashionable
and were only enhanced with powders, sometimes tinted purple, pink, or blue. But not everyone bought into the trend. Caricaturists mocked big wig-wearers,
framing them as frivolously flamboyant. And the hotter temperatures
in some of Europe's colonies might have made heavy powdered wigs
a nuisance. In 1740, a visitor in Maryland observed
that so few people wore wigs, he said, ""you would imagine they
were all sick, or going to bed."" In the late 1700s, a popular backlash against aristocratic
decadence gained steam. As France faced a bread shortage, flour-powdered wigs were viewed
as particularly problematic. And in 1789, the French Revolution
kicked off. In 1795, England's parliament
passed a ""powder tax"" that led many to abandon their big wigs. And so, they fell out of fashion,
left high and powder-dry, like mere relics of a hair-brained
past craze."
Why is Alzheimer’s disease so difficult to treat? - Krishna Sudhir,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT5pDvdMzhk,351.0,en,"Around the world, tens of millions
of people have Alzheimer's disease, a debilitating brain disorder that
gradually destroys a person's memory and other cognitive abilities. It takes a heavy toll on both
patients and families, as caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's
can be emotionally overwhelming and financially difficult. While doctors have studied
Alzheimer's for decades, conducting hundreds of clinical trials, there is still no effective preventive
treatment or cure. So, why is Alzheimer's disease
so difficult to treat? Alzheimer's accounts for 60 to 80%
of all dementia patients worldwide. Dementia is a broader term,
used to describe a variety of conditions that affect a patient's memory,
thinking skills, and everyday functions. Most Alzheimer's patients first notice
symptoms in their 60s,  experiencing mild memory problems, like losing track of dates
or forgetting what they just learned. Some experience other changes,
like frequent shifts in mood, increased anxiety and agitation, and problems with coping
in new situations. Symptoms typically progress
gradually over years and eventually a person with Alzheimer's
may require constant care. Some rare forms of Alzheimer's are caused
by a single inherited gene variant. But most of the time Alzheimer's
is due to the complex interaction of multiple genes in combination with
lifestyle and environmental factors, so it's impossible to predict
who will develop the disease. Alzheimer's involves a long,
chronic process, resulting in many changes to the brain, that likely starts to unfold at least 1 to
2 decades before symptoms first appear. So it's been difficult
for scientists to pinpoint exactly what triggers this process and what causes the many symptoms
of Alzheimer's. But thanks to continued research, they're
beginning to put this puzzle together. Initially, scientists noticed that
the brains of Alzheimer's patients display an abnormal buildup of
a compound called beta-amyloid. Beta-amyloid is created
when a large protein, amyloid-beta precursor protein, or APP,
is broken down. APP plays an essential role in the brain,
aiding in neural growth and repair. However, in Alzheimer's patients, it's
thought that APP is improperly cleaved, creating sticky beta-amyloid byproducts,
which easily clump together. These plaques can build up in the spaces
between neurons, and interfere with normal brain signaling. But this likely isn't the full story. While all patients with Alzheimer's
have plaques, not all people with plaques have
or will develop dementia. And Alzheimer's symptoms don't
always become more severe as plaques accumulate in the brain. In the 1980s, another protein, tau,
emerged as a possible contributor. Tau's normal role is as
a scaffolding protein, to help reinforce the internal structure
of neurons and give them their shape. But in Alzheimer's patients,
tau is modified and misfolded, causing it, like beta-amyloid,
to become sticky and to clump. These tau tangles accumulate
within neurons and are toxic, causing the cells to eventually die. In patients, plaques normally
appear before tangles, yet questions still remain.  Do amyloid plaques trigger
tau dysfunction? And why exactly do these abnormal proteins
lead to such specific disease symptoms? To make matters more complex, recent studies have found that Alzheimer's
is closely linked to changes in the way immune cells, called microglia,
function in the brain. Others have found that Alzheimer's
may also be caused by problems in the junctions between neurons,
called synapses. And alterations in the way the brain
produces and burns energy may also be an underlying factor. Together, all this suggests that 
Alzheimer's is likely caused by a complex cascade of events. And teasing out the order of events,
and how to stop it once it starts, will take more research. But there are things patients can
do to better manage symptoms. Staying active, learning new skills, and even participating
in daily activities, like household chores, seems to slow disease progression. Medications that target neurotransmitters,
the brain's signaling molecules, can slow memory loss
and help with learning and reasoning. And scientists continue to develop
new therapies. For example, drugs that target
beta-amyloid have shown promise in slowing the disease and reducing plaque
accumulation in the brain. Alzheimer's disease won't
go away anytime soon. Dementia cases are expected 
to double in the next 20 years. But continued research holds
the promise of better treatment and perhaps one day, prevention, as scientists piece the Alzheimer's
puzzle together."
What the oil industry doesn’t want you to know - Stephanie Honchell Smith,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vDZmVXtA7k,405.0,en,"In summer 1997, a full-page ad appeared
in The New York Times. The message, from the
Global Climate Coalition, issued a dire economic warning about the
US embracing the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But beneath the veneer of smiling children
was something much more insidious: a multi-million dollar campaign
propped up by questionable data and backed by some of the world's
most powerful companies. The Global Climate Coalition was itself
a front for the oil industry— established to sow doubt and confusion
about climate action. But the real story starts decades earlier. In the 1970s, oil companies employed some
of the world's top atmospheric scientists, as they needed to understand
weather-related risks to their equipment and to assess the environmental
impact of new projects. By the late 1970s, these scientists,
along with their counterparts in academia, had concluded that burning fossil fuels
created a build up of atmospheric carbon, which would impact the climate
by trapping heat and increasing surface temperatures. They warned that an increase of even
a few degrees could be catastrophic and accurately predicted events
such as rapid Arctic warming and the melting of Antarctic ice sheets. Throughout the 1980s, oil industry reps
met repeatedly to discuss these dangers, acknowledging the risk that their product
posed to the future of humanity. However, instead of warning the public, or using this knowledge to pivot
towards renewable energy sources, they doubled down on oil. But in the late 1980s, scientists sounded
the alarm about climate change, raising public awareness, and
leading to calls for government action. In response, the oil industry launched
what would become a decades-long, multi-billion-dollar PR campaign to discredit the very science
they helped pioneer. They utilized the same PR firms that had
previously helped the tobacco industry  mislead the public
about the harms of smoking. Oil companies directly lobbied
government officials and covertly funded dozens
of organizations like the Global Climate Coalition, whose objective was to obscure the
scientific consensus on climate change and humanity's role in creating it. They attacked credible scientists  and bankrolled advertisements
disguised as op-eds, which falsely exaggerated the degree
and significance of uncertainty in climate models and used that uncertainty as an excuse
to dismiss the science entirely. These ""advertorials"" grabbed
reader's attention with titles like ""Lies They Tell Our Children,""
and ""Unsettled Science."" The industry also capitalized
on lingering Cold War anxieties that equated government regulation
with socialism.  Thus, at the very moment
the world was poised to act, oil companies shifted the conversation
away from the actual science and turned it into a debate
about protecting freedom. By doing so, they took a non-partisan,
uncontentious topic and transformed it into a
hot-button political issue. After George W. Bush became
president in 2001, oil lobbyists successfully pushed his
administration to replace officials who agreed with mainstream science  with ones who opposed
environmental regulations. When Bush pushed the US
out of the Kyoto Protocol, his administration credited
the Global Climate Coalition with influencing his decision. But the oil industry's PR campaigns
didn't end with their Kyoto victory. They've continued to shape
the climate conversation, pushing propaganda and co-opting
climate language. British Petroleum, for example,
popularized the phrase ""carbon footprint,"" an idea which in practice effectively
shifts climate responsibility from the industry to the consumer. To this day, the industry massively
overemphasizes their investment  in green energies,
such as biofuels,  which represent just 1% of their budgets. And they employ legions of lobbyists,
who attend UN climate meetings and work to water down the language
of IPCC climate assessment reports. In this, they're allied with
oil-producing countries, which also have a vested interest
in continued fossil fuel use. While the oil companies now acknowledge
that burning fossil fuels  contributes to climate change, they deny having misled the public, arguing that their messaging always
reflected the scientific consensus. But an extensive paper trail
shows otherwise. While oil companies' profits
reach all-time highs, climate change costs the public
billions of dollars each year. Extreme weather events and decreasing air
quality kill millions of people annually. Meanwhile, the culture of doubt the
oil industry created remains widespread, polarizing the issue,
and delaying meaningful action. But it doesn't have to be this way. We can still reclaim the conversation
and change course, embracing renewable energies
and sustainable practices to protect both our planet and our future."
Why does hitting your funny bone feel so horrible? - Cella Wright,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwYut9qF-jM,259.0,en,"Whatever you were doing, there was no way
to anticipate what came next. The back of your elbow smacked
against a hard surface and the impact sent a sensation
so distinctly disquieting shooting down your arm that it took
several moments to regain composure. So, why does hitting this spot
on your elbow— often referred to as your funny bone—
feel so weird? Well, to start, your elbow is one of the
most complicated joints in your body. It's where your upper arm bone,
the humerus, meets the two bones of your forearm.  Three main nerves run through your elbow. One of them, the ulnar nerve, is
particularly relevant for our purposes. Your ulnar nerve is composed of both
sensory and motor nerve fibers. It extends from your spine to the tips
of your fourth and fifth fingers, providing them with sensation along with
swaths of your forearm and hand. So, say your little finger gets
crushed by a car door. Sensory receptors in your
pinky finger's tissues register that unfortunate information and send electrical impulses
up the ulnar nerve,  which are then processed
in your central nervous system. This leads to the perception
of acute, sharp pain, followed by aching. So that's how your ulnar nerve
generally works. But your elbow has an anatomical quirk
that leaves your ulnar nerve vulnerable to getting activated in a different way. Along almost all of its length,
your ulnar nerve is protected, hidden beneath muscle, fat, and bone. Thankfully, this is generally true
of your nerves. But when your ulnar nerve
reaches your elbow, it runs beneath the bony bump
at the bottom of your humerus, named the medial epicondyle, and it passes through a tunnel of ligament
and muscle tissue called the cubital tunnel.  When you bend your elbow, your ulnar nerve gets flattened
against the medial epicondyle and the protective tissue
in the area gets displaced, bringing the nerve especially close
to the skin's surface. In this position, the ulnar nerve
is covered only by skin and cubital tunnel ligament tissue, making it perhaps the longest area
of semi-exposed nerve in your body. So, when the area is struck at the
right angle with enough force, something interesting happens. Instead of the sensation simply activating
peripheral receptors that send electrical signals
along your ulnar nerve, the nerve's fibers are
stimulated directly. This is why hitting your so-called
funny bone hits different. The exact mechanisms aren't
yet fully understood. But the impact alters
the ulnar nerve's signaling, perhaps by causing a proliferation
of nerve signals, leading to that intense
pins-and-needles sensation called transient paresthesia, which radiates down the length
of your arm. In rare cases, whacks to this special spot have led to temporary loss
of consciousness, perhaps because a hard enough strike
could disrupt nerve signaling and blood flow.  In addition to these more
immediately distressing moments, regular bent-elbow activities are
thought to put pressure on the ulnar nerve over time. Ulnar nerve entrapment is a relatively
common condition. It happens when the ulnar nerve becomes
compressed and obstructed, most commonly with the cubital tunnel. The result of this chronic ulnar nerve
pain can be persistent paresthesia, as well as weakness
in the forearm and hand. In the hopes of preventing
such conditions, doctors recommend conscientious
elbow usage. That includes stretching your arms
and straightening your elbows, and generally taking breaks that
help provide regular relief and maximal blood flow
to your ulnar nerve."
Why fish are better at breathing than you are - Dan Kwartler,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH3O69BscYg,321.0,en,"In 2019, Eliud Kipchoge finished
a Vienna marathon in one hour, 59 minutes, and 40 seconds. This staggering time broke
the two-hour barrier that most runners previously
deemed impossible. However, some researchers
weren't as surprised. Recent studies investigating if humans
could maintain such a high pace for the length of a marathon
had found that elite runners can take in twice as much oxygen
as non-runners. And it’s likely that this superhuman
ability played a role in Eliud’s victory. But when it comes
to breathing efficiently, not even the best runners in the world
can compete with the average fish. That’s right— you’re looking at some
of the best breathers on Earth; which actually makes sense when you
consider how little oxygen there is in their aquatic environments. Fish can breathe in a variety of ways, but the most common
is through the use of gills. These branching organs typically
come in four pairs, all enclosed in gill chambers. These chambers are protected
by opercle, or gill covers, which are just as essential to underwater
breathing as the gills themselves. When most fish take a breath, they first close these covers
and take a gulp of water. Then, they open their opercle, creating a pressure differential
that pulls water through the gills, which are composed of thread-like
filaments spaced evenly along a gill arch. These filaments are covered in countless
small blood vessels called capillaries, in addition to tiny extensions
known as gill lamellae which further increase 
the gill’s surface area. When water passes over these capillaries, the membrane is thin enough
for the fish’s red blood cells to pull dissolved oxygen from the water
into the bloodstream. And just like when we breathe
with our lungs, this process releases carbon dioxide, which passes out into the water
through the open gill cover. This technique only works underwater— on the surface, the pressure differential
created by opening and closing gill covers isn’t strong enough to pull
in sufficient air. But under the surface,
it’s remarkably efficient. Inside the lamellae, blood flows
in the opposite direction to the water, creating a counter-current system
that optimizes gas exchange. In fact, gills can absorb roughly 75%
of the oxygen passing through them; that’s twice the percentage of oxygen
our lungs extract from a breath of air. Fish also breathe much more frequently
than we do. The average adult human breathes
12 to 18 times a minute, while most fish pull water
over their gills anywhere from 20 to 80 times a minute. Those numbers would raise
even a marathoner’s eyebrows. Thanks to this fast, frequent,
and efficient breathing fish process far more oxygen than we do. It's also why some species
can live at great depths. Bodies of water get most
of their oxygen from the surface, where O2 dissolves into the water
and begins circulating. But further down, there are
oxygen minimum zones, with concentrations as low as
0.5 milligrams of oxygen per liter. To get the oxygen they need, fish living at these depths rely
on increased gill ventilation and hearts that pump high volumes of
oxygenated blood throughout the body. Even with these tricks, sometimes there's
still not enough oxygen to go around, forcing fish to adapt
more extreme solutions. For example, the Australian lungfish
lives in a habitat where the water level drops precipitously
in August and September, making it almost impossible
to survive with gills alone. Fortunately, these fish
have gills and lungs. Using their long, thin limbs, they can lift their mouths above the
surface and take deep breaths of air, allowing them to survive out of the water
for several days. And other species of lungfish can survive
above ground even longer in cocoons of mud and mucus. Fortunately, for most fish these extreme
adaptations aren’t necessary. After all, 71% of Earth is covered in H2O, giving these aquatic animals plenty
of room to flaunt their gills’ skills."
How do doctors determine what stage of cancer you have? - Hyunsoo Joshua No and Trudy Wu,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwCBEgjUluU,329.0,en,"Each year, approximately 20 million
people across the world receive a cancer diagnosis. At this overwhelming,
and often scary time, a patient usually learns
their cancer’s stage, which is typically a number,
ranging from 1 to 4. While staging is designed in part
to help patients better understand what they’re facing, extracting this information
from a simple number can be confusing
and less than straightforward. So, what do cancer stages actually mean? To understand stage numbers, we first need to unpack
the three variables that inform it. Doctors utilize a system which uses
the letters T, N, and M to describe a tumor’s size, its presence in the immune system’s
lymph nodes, and whether it has metastasized,
or spread, to other organs. Arriving at this letter staging
takes thorough investigation— physicians will consider a person’s
symptoms and overall health, and may sample, or biopsy,
cancerous tissue, order medical scans,
and analyze blood tests. The T designation is usually
a number between 1 to 4, and is, in most cases,
based on tumor size. But each type of cancer has
its own T staging criteria. Five-centimeter-wide tumors are labeled
as T3 in oral cancers, but T2 in breast cancers. And some cancers use
other staging criteria, like esophageal cancers, which are staged
based on how deeply the tumor invades the layers of tissue. To assign an N stage, doctors evaluate the lymph nodes
through biopsies and imaging. Cancer cells tend to break off
from the initial tumor and spread. They often travel through the
lymphatic system— a network of vessels and nodes, which filter waste and harbor cells
that help fight infection. Cancers that spread to larger,
more distant, or a greater number of lymph nodes
typically file into higher N stages. M staging involves a more threatening
category of cancers’ spread— when diseased cells scatter and then
settle on other organs or on bones. Historically, this stage has been
a matter of just “yes” or “no,” because once a cancer has metastasized,
it’s considered to be much more lethal. But advances in treatment have recently
prompted the medical community to rethink the M stage as a continuum. Doctors now consider the number of organs
in which the cancer has spread, as well as the abundance and
characteristics of the metastatic tumors. All sorts of combinations
of T, N, and M are possible, and one letter doesn't always
follow the other. For example, some head and neck cancers
will test positive in the lymph nodes N1 with no clear initial tumor,
or T0. So how do these three variables inform
a cancer's stage number? Each TNM combination correlates
to a different overall stage, ordered by how difficult
the cancer is to treat. This sorting is rigidly defined
for each type of cancer, based on generations of research looking
at how cancers with different spreads and characteristics tend to behave. Importantly, what a certain overall stage
means varies from cancer to cancer. For example, a T3N1M0 combination
for a breast cancer is considered stage 3 and carries
an 85% five-year survival rate. A pancreatic cancer with this same
TNM combination, however, is sorted to stage 2,
and yet is more difficult to treat with a 15% survival rate. The system is intricate—
and ever-changing. For instance, someone with a stage 4
throat tumor in 2017, might be considered stage 1
just one year later. The cancer didn’t improve;
the staging system did. Experts realized that a subset
of these advanced cancers responded to existing treatment
better than others, so their staging was downgraded. Similar discoveries and advancements
in the genetic testing of tumors are refining staging in breast, prostate,
and gynecological cancers. Meanwhile, breakthroughs in therapies can
change things seemingly overnight. Many cancers one considered
near impossible to treat are now met with high rates of remission. And thanks to improvements in screenings, more and more cancers are being
discovered at early stages. So while many will deal
with the reality of cancer, either for themselves,
or through the diagnosis of a loved one, these advances offer better treatments,
more targeted cures, and greater hope for the years to come."
"How to love, according to Rumi - Stephanie Honchell Smith",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNw9x53Ybos,371.0,en,"“A candle is made to become
entirely flame. In that annihilating moment
it has no shadow.” According to legend, the renowned scholar,
Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi, was giving a lecture when an older,
disheveled man approached and asked him the meaning
of his academic books. Rumi didn’t know it yet,
but this question and this man would change his life. Annoyed at the interruption, Rumi snapped, “They are something that
you do not understand!” Suddenly, the books caught fire. The man looked back at the astounded Rumi
and simply replied: “You couldn’t possibly understand.” The mysterious figure was Shams of Tabriz, a charismatic Sufi mystic who would
transform Rumi's worldview. Rumi, inspired by Shams’ teachings, would go on to become one of the world’s
most celebrated poets and mystical philosophers, whose cultural legacy looms large across
Türkiye and the Persian-speaking world. Rumi was born in 1207
near the Afghan city of Balkh, and as a child emigrated to Anatolia,
where his father— a preacher and mystic— hoped to secure a more
prestigious position. By the time of Shams’ arrival, Rumi was a well-respected scholar
of Islamic law in the town of Konya. While he had been exposed to Sufism— the mystical path within Islam,
which focuses on experiencing God’s love— he’d shown little interest in it. But this changed in his late thirties,
when Shams came into his life. The academic study of law and theology
was no longer Rumi's central focus. Rather, he saw them as candles guiding
the way towards his ultimate goal: the reunification of his soul with God
through the experience of divine love. He wrote of this tension
in his native Persian, “Love resides not in learning,
not in knowledge, not in pages and books. Wherever the debates of men may lead,
that is not the lover’s path.” While Sufism had been part
of Islamic observance for centuries, the practices of some Sufis—
from ecstatic dancing to composing poetry— were looked down upon by conservative
religious elites. As Rumi increasingly embraced Sufism
under Shams’ influence, many of his earlier followers disapproved. When Shams suddenly disappeared,
suspicions arose that he'd been murdered. Rumi expressed his devastation
through poetry: “He bathed us like a candle in his light;
in thin air vanished, left us!” Rather than turning away from Sufism,
Rumi became more devoted, participating in ritualized dancing
and preaching the religion of love through lectures, poetry, and prose. And while Shams would never return,
Rumi continued to share his teachings, seeing himself as the moon
reflecting the light of Shams’ sun. While in his mystical states,
he composed the “Divan-i-Shams,” a sprawling collection of lyrical poems that included many of the sayings
for which he is famous today. The work expresses intense feelings
of love and longing, not only for his vanished mentor,
but for the divine creator. Over time, Rumi's poetry matured. He no longer saw himself
as a reflection of Shams, but as a beacon of light on his own. In his early fifties,
Rumi wrote “Masnavi,” which shifts from ecstatic expressions
of divine love to verses that guide others
to discover it for themselves. The poems are complex and layered, incorporating ideas, stories, and quotes
from Islamic religious texts, Arabic and Persian literature,
and earlier Sufi writings and poetry. In one story, he invokes the well-known
characters of Layla and the love-crazed Majnun. In Rumi’s version, the king, hearing Majnun’s musings
on Layla’s unsurpassed beauty, demands to see her. But when Layla arrives, he’s confused, as her beauty pales in comparison
to Majnun's praises. To this, Layla replies, “I am Layla.
The problem is you are not Majnun.” For Rumi, experiencing love meant opening
his heart to all of God’s creation— looking at everything and everyone
like Majnun gazing upon Layla. In this way, he saw romantic love
as an expression— on a smaller scale— of divine love. Following Rumi’s death, the Mevlevi Sufi
order was established around his teachings and still exists in Türkiye today. His poems and other writings were copied
and dispersed across the Islamic world, inspiring and shaping Persian poetry, before being introduced to the West
in the 19th century. For generations, his works have been
read and reread, translated and reinterpreted,
drawing admirers from around the world. While Rumi's words reflect his specific
historical context and Islamic worldview, for many, his message feels universal: “If you have lost heart
in the Path of Love, flee to me without delay: I am a fortress invincible.”"
"Why don't ""tough"" and ""dough"" rhyme? - Arika Okrent",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFhY4Vy3IHc,334.0,en,"It was June 2010. Inside the Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestants between 8- and 15-years-old
wrestled words like brachydactylous and leguleian. Outside, a crowd protested the complexity
of English spelling conventions. Indeed, spelling reformers have
been around for centuries, advocating for overarching changes to make
English spelling more intuitive. The English language is chock-full
of irregularities. One commonly used example of this:
take the “g-h” sound from “enough,” the “o” sound from “women,”
and the “t-i” sound from “action,” and you could argue that
“g-h-o-t-i” spells “fish.” So, how did English get like this? English arose from old Germanic
tribes that invaded the British Isles more than 1,500 years ago. Their languages coalesced and evolved
into Old English. When Roman missionaries arrived
around 600 CE, they devised ways to write it
down using the Latin alphabet, supplementing it with some Germanic runes
for sounds they didn’t have letters for. Then came the Norman invasion of 1066
when French speakers conquered England. French became the language
of authority and high society. But English remained the dominant
spoken language. Over time, those descended from French
speakers also became English speakers, but some French words snuck
into the language. Some English speakers were also familiar
with Latin through the church and formal education. By the mid-1400s, people were writing
in English again— but it was unstandardized. They used a mix of influences to determine
word choice and spelling, including the French they knew,
the Latin they studied, and the English they spoke. So, things were already pretty messy. Then, in 1476, the printing press
arrived in England. Some of the people working the presses
may have mainly spoken Flemish— not English. And they were given manuscripts
that varied widely in their spelling. Without standardization, different writers
went with various spellings based in part on what they happened
to encounter while reading. Many words had a multitude of spellings. The word “dough,” for instance, used to be spelled in all these ways
and was originally pronounced “dach.” The guttural Germanic sound it ended with
was one the Latin alphabet didn’t cover. It eventually came to be
represented with “g-h.” But, for some “g-h” words, English speakers eventually dropped
the guttural sound altogether; for others, they ended up pronouncing
it as “f” instead, as exemplified in “dough” versus “tough.” Printing presses memorialized
the spelling even though the pronunciation
eventually changed. And this wasn’t just the case with “g-h.” Some letters in other words
also fell silent: words like knife, gnat, and wrong all contain the vestiges
of past pronunciations. But while the printing press
was solidifying spellings, the English language was also undergoing
what scholars call the Great Vowel Shift. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the way English speakers pronounced
many vowels changed significantly. For instance, “bawt” became “boat.” This displaced the word for “boot,” which had up until then
been pronounced “boat,” and pushed it into the high “u” vowel
position it maintains today. Words that already had this high “u”
often became diphthongs, with two vowels in a single syllable. So, “hus” became “house.” As with so many linguistic matters,
there's no clear reason why this happened. But it did. And how the vowel shift affected a word
depended on various things, including the other sounds in the word. The word “tough” was once “tōh,”
among other variations. “Through” was once “thruch”
and “dough” “dah.” These words all started
with different vowel sounds that were then affected differently
by the vowel shift. The “o-u” spelling they all adopted was
a haphazardly applied French influence. So, eventually they wound up with
still distinct vowel sounds, but similar spellings
that don’t really make much sense. All this means English can be
a difficult language for non-native speakers to learn. And it reveals the many ways history,
in all its messiness, acted upon English,
making it especially tough."
How could so many people support Hitler? - Joseph Lacey,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcdufLc3QSA,310.0,en,"In Jerusalem, on April 11th, 1961, Adolf Eichmann stood trial
for crimes against humanity. Eichmann had been a Nazi official
tasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews
to ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described
as an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities
from a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called
“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand
seemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature
and his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired
a disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled
her homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned
by the German secret police. As a refugee in France
and then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding
how the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,
how it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that
the Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens
looking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions
behind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism
weren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed
a theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy
our material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s
physical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly
articulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,
the life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other
industrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age
ruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear
in the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas
and shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered
societies and ideologies where individuals were seen only
for their economic value, rather than their moral
and political capacities. She believed this isolated people from
their neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,
“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided
fertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence
to increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage
as freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,
participating in the regime becomes the only way to recover
a sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this
kind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected
the Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned
his monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann
himself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man
who considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this
ordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone
could do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested
ordinary people could willingly accept
their societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon
“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever
society inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,
to question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is
the only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility
to self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking
in oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires
personal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held
Eichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted
that thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic
and technological development which would increase social alienation
and inhibit human freedom. To foster this essential value, Arendt believed we need to create
formal and informal forums that allowed for open conversations
about shaping our collective future. These might include townhall meetings,
self-governing workplaces, or student unions. But whatever shape they take, what’s most important to Arendt
is that they value open dialogue and critical self-reflection."
The rise and fall of the Maya Empire’s most powerful city - Geoffrey E. Braswell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulHWR0Dp6Rk,332.0,en,"During an important calendrical
celebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat
atop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub
he’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast
K’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known
the crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing
agriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous
Central American settlements. This shifted the center
of their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,
and Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock
rapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities
to collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza
is pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an
abundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when
drought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become
the most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds
of kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s
population possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse
international culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining
a large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,
following K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted
from a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils
of the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with
destructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely
on economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might
into establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from
coastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,
turquoise, and jade from various parts
of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city
into a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid
and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,
around each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows
that slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations
of Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited
by gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated
at Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence
of thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s
golden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit
and lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities
in nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the
watery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages
and the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself
through this extended drought. Population plummeted
during the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza
as the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully
abandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital
of a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name
was preserved, and its ancient stone constructions
were still standing, as they do to this day."
"Why is ""The Scream"" screaming? - Noah Charney",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teJAmgiMVIo,323.0,en,"An undulating sky melds
into the landscape, two silhouettes move
along a balustraded walkway, and a ghostly figure’s features
extend in agony. Since Norwegian artist Edvard Munch
created “The Scream” in 1893, it’s become one of the world’s
most famous artworks. But why has its cry traveled so far
and endured so long? Munch was born in 1863,
one of five children. Tuberculosis devastated Europe
throughout the 1800s, killing almost a quarter of all adults. It took Munch’s mother’s life,
then his elder sister’s. Soon after, Munch had his own bout
of the disease. Another of his sisters experienced
mental illness and lived much of her life
in an institution. Meanwhile, Munch flitted in and out
of school due to illness, often spending days at home, drawing and listening to the ominous
stories his father read aloud. A devout Lutheran, his father considered
Munch’s artistic ambitions unholy. “I inherited the seeds of madness,”
Munch wrote. “The angels of fear, sorrow, and death
stood by my side since the day I was born.” Eventually, Munch moved to Berlin,
where he frequented creative circles committed to breaking
with academic tradition and instead developing
their crafts organically. While Munch had trained classically, he began immersing himself
in what he called “soul painting”— compositions that prized raw, subjective
affect over realistic rendering. “It’s not the chair that should
be painted,” he wrote, “but what a person has felt
at the sight of it.” Many of Munch’s works dealt
with personal suffering. This may have also led to what
certain critics observed as unsympathetic portrayals of women in works where Munch represented them as
cruel predators victimizing hapless men. And death often haunted
Munch’s compositions— from a skeleton helming a boat
to a morbid self-portrait and his sister's final moments
to a mother on her deathbed, her child assuming
a now-familiar expression. Munch’s art generated controversy— some critics characterizing him
as “absolutely demented”— but it also drew acclaim. And what would become his most famous work
was just around the corner. “The Scream” was inspired by a moment
that overwhelmed Munch with an acute sense of anguish. In a diary entry marked
January 22nd, 1892, Munch described walking with
two friends along a fjord overlooking what’s now Oslo at sunset. He leaned against a fence, exhausted,
as he saw the sky change suddenly. He described “blood and tongues of fire
above the blue-black fjord and the city.” As his friends walked on, Munch wrote,
“I stood there trembling with anxiety— and I sensed an infinite scream
passing through nature.” As with other painful experiences,
Munch revisited the scene repeatedly. First, he depicted it with a more
recognizably human subject. But the following year, he surrendered
it to dramatic, abstracted symbolism, the haunting expression
on the figure’s skull-like face meeting the viewer’s gaze directly. On this first version,
he added a subtle, wry inscription: “Could only have been painted
by a madman!” Based on Munch’s account, many think
the figure isn’t emitting the shriek but reacting to it. Munch eventually made four versions
of “The Scream”— all on cardboard, two with pastel,
two with paint— and he created numerous prints
and lithographs. The year following the first “Scream,”
he depicted the same setting but featured a collection
of despairing faces. In late 1893, Munch premiered “The Scream”
at a solo exhibit in Berlin. The artwork’s bold composition helped
fuel the Expressionist movement, which likewise emphasized
stark psychological states, mapping the emotional contours
of World War I and beyond. “The Scream” continued its crescendo. When it entered the public domain
in the mid-1900s, new renditions and reproductions
bolstered its fame. It featured in popular films
during the 1990s, and both painted versions of “The Scream”
were stolen and recovered in separate heists in 1994 and 2004. Soon enough, it was a widely accepted
archetypal symbol for horror and angst. A “Scream”-inspired emoji was
eventually implemented. And, considering how to mark hazardous
sites so far-off future generations could know to avoid them, the US government has considered
using “The Scream” expression. While its myriad cultural influences
may not always reflect the personal agony
Munch initially rendered, “The Scream” has certainly found
a near universal echo."
